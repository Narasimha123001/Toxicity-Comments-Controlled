"Unbelievable, if as many people would lie for other criminals as the Secret Service has had we could close the prisons and let our country run wild. Americans haven't learned ANYTHING since John F. Kennedy. Warren Commission RIGHT ?"
"Stephen Gardner ,(podcast), had on a guest that said,
There are 5  assassin's that came in illegally,  ordered to kill 
Donald Trump,
(he said, the Democrats will go to great extents to stay in power)."
HEY  kislux  !! I have been watching you for years and im so proud of where you have made it! I love you so much!  Also thanks for making my day <3
Natoho skurvy syna  general komunystu prezidenta cesky rep.
Trump is a fool.....he doesnt understand that it is Israel which is  behind his assasination bids because they know for Trump it is America first not Israel first
How did that guy know Trump would be playing golf at that time im sure trump didntmake that known .to any one
I don’t understand. They want these high ass prices ? Trump had everything so cheap no conflict or threats to get blown up. Now we’re threatened every day and those not fed a silver spoon are struggling financially mentally. Everything. The fuck ?
"They want to frighten or get rid of him, because they know he might win the election."

This America elections reminds me of the movie The General's Daughter(Diego) and Asintado(Salvador) when they were seeking elective position
Any kind of scam the dysfunctional Republicans can do for the rapist and Coward called Donald Trump true facts
I am sure nato is using RNM adavance talking system that can talk with human like them without knowing it can make diffrences in upcpming election of usa i am dealing with taking system that is prepared by nato
The Republican party doing everything to steal the election. It's the whole Republican strategy to cheat and lie because they already know they will lose the election.
I'm so happy Trump is safe and well.
"trumps own supporters,wants him gone"
"It was all staged by trump , faked for more campaign money . Suckers send your  $5 to the billionaire."
The globalists really don’t want him to be re-elected
I don't know about the rest of you but I'm starting to get pissed off at Trump with all these attempts on him he needs to just not do his rallies we all know what he stands for he's already gotten the word out and I think the only reason he goes to this rallies is because he just wants to be on the TV I think Trump is starting to think more of his self than us people out here that want him into office all it takes is just one time and then we are screwed so he's not thinking about us he's the only thinking about him he needs to get over it do a few videos for the rest of the month stay secure until he becomes president so that he can get a better security detail otherwise if they take him out we're screwed
"America has become a 3rd World country. They're forcing other countries to implement democracy but they don't have democracy in there their country. A develop country like America wants to kill Jesus, making King, President Trump"
Republicans really want to take Trump out
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? 🙄
Hmmmmmmmmmm........"
"The Evidence
Matas said, when they did the investigation, they looked for evidence that either supported the existence of the crime, or evidence that indicated the crime wasn’t happening. Every piece of evidence they found all pointed to the same conclusion – organ harvesting is happening. 

In their investigation, they interviewed Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners who were held in various detention centers or prisons in China. They found that these Falun Gong practitioners went through extensive physical examinations, especially blood tests and tissue typing. This wasn’t for their health, as most of them were also subjected to savage beating and other torture. From their description, the examination was mostly likely used to build a database for organ matching. At the same time, the authorities only performed such examinations on Falun Gong practitioners, not any of the non-practitioners held in the same detention facilities.

One Falun Gong practitioner who was tortured in a Chinese prison and underwent involuntary blood test recounted the experience during the seminar.

While the real number of organ transplants is a state secret in China, just based on the limited numbers published by the CCP, it can be seen that organ transplant numbers significantly increased soon after the persecution of Falun Gong began. The CCP claimed that the organs came from donation, but China didn’t have an organ donation system and it’s also against the Chinese tradition to donate one’s organs after death. 

As another piece of evidence, some investigators pretended to be patients and they called various hospitals, asking whether they had fresh Falun Gong organs available, as Falun Gong practitioners had very a healthy lifestyle, unlike other inmates who may be addicted to smoking or drugs. The answer they got from the doctors was, “Yes, we have these organs, just make an appointment and come.”

Some Chinese hospitals listed prices for various organs and one can make an appointment for the transplants of vital organs, including heart and liver. 

In China, there was a law that gives hospitals permission to extract organs from death row prisoners without their or their family’s consent. This furthers greenlights the organ harvesting crimes, which has evolved into a massive, lucrative industry.

The CCP never admitted that they harvested organs from living Falun Gong practitioners. They claimed that the organs came from donation of death row prisoners, who wanted to make up for their wrongdoings. But the number of death row prisoners was far less than the transplants.

In 2014, the investigation team conducted another round of research. They went to the websites and publications by 169 individual Chinese hospitals approved by the government to conduct transplants and collected data regarding transplant types performed, qualifications, revenue, potential patient demographics, bed counts, surgical and support personnel, transplant capacity and volume, research projects, relationships with other hospitals and related entities, funding, patents, and awards.

They estimated that the total transplants performed by these hospitals were between 60,000 and 100,000 every year, far more than the 10,000 transplants per year claimed by the CCP. And the numbers seemed to keep increasing over the years. If this is true, the numbers of Falun Gong practitioners being “executed” on operation tables could add up to millions.

Matas said, “What I can tell you is that everyone who has read these books (of our investigation) and done their own research has, without exception, come to the same conclusion that we have. As the China Tribunal has said, this is undoubtedly sensible and this is real.”

He added: “Because I am Jewish and I am very familiar with the Holocaust, I am not shocked by the extraordinary symptoms of violence. I see it. I know it is possible. I am disappointed and I see it happening.”

Stop the Crime"
Its not rocket science. Trumps obviously paying guys to take a shot and miss so he can claim all the sympathetic votes and millions in donations. If an American had a brain they could work it out too.

AS YOU MAY KNOW the marxist JEWS will not kill a good president pushing the potential of humanity as they did with JFKennedy. Not this time  stooges and I am jewish. I am voting Trump. F marxism and globalism.
If you take out the colon and quotes the titles very telling

They really want a war don't they?
"I wonder why people wanna hurt trump-the-felon?  Geez, could it be he incite so much hatred & violence, and it came back to bite him in the ass."
"2:02 
cockroach wanted to say hi :3"
"""Drone"" spotted Ryan Routh getting into his getaway car. Following 4 warning shots  beening heard. 
If the Secrete Service officer was ""close enough"" to spot a tip of a rifle among a chainlink fencing. 
Ryan Routh in fleeing; left a AK47 ""Style"" rifle 
behind, with two bags.
(Note after 6 hours an OPEN news conferance was held)
The three law enforcement agencies all gave their account of their involvement and the FACTS..

NOT ONE of the agencies;  mentioned any ammunition being found with the AK47 
Nor did they mention that the AK47 style rifle  was found ""loaded"" 

This was fresh OPEN  information as it happens. 

Two days later when the public questioned the absence of ammunition.. the report wording was changed to 
They found a ""LOADED"" AK47 STYLE rifle..   Still no further information, like how many rounds of ammunition was ""loaded"" 
Given a rifle is only an asanation weapon, if it has ammunition.  So crucial to the intent of Ryan Routh. ????"
"Staged. First incident improved his rating. And since currently his rating is going down, another incident can get back his scores."
"Hmmmm.... Trump is under close supervision by the United States Secret Service. This institution has the main task of protecting the president from all forms of threats, including assassination attempts. The advanced technology and security protocols implemented by the Secret Service are extremely difficult to penetrate, and history shows that only a handful of American presidents have ever been successfully assassinated. With such a high level of security, the possibility of success in carrying out Trump's assassination is very small. However, the threat to his life is not something that can be ignored, considering the nature of the position he occupies 🥇🇮🇩🧐😘🥰"
"BBC cant help themselves . They are so anti Trump that they use quote sign indicating that the report is probably a joke.  BBC is a joke. I remember BBC when the truth mattered.  They are so fond of accusing right wing people of violence that they refuse to see that Marxist, liberal. wokers are at fault."
Omg trump will make usa great AGAIN
"The history of presidential elections in the U.S. has seen its fair share of drama, but an assassination attempt on Trump? This is making us look like a third-world country."
Old news
Go Trump. Make your country great again. More countries need real leaders who fight for their country people and not their bank accounts.  Love from South Africa.
Democrats praying for 3rd time lucky.
third time lucky  ??
"Is it just me or does anyone else think the level of security is suspect, how fk does anyone with a rifle get anywhere near a leading candidate for the president."
This is a inside job clearly i don't like Trump but i don't wish anyone death i'll be glad once this is over & i pray he can't continue to run for president ever again
"When have the good guys in history ever been the ones to attempt assassinations, censor the free flow of information and hand pick their nominees without an open primary? NEVER. Those always describe the bad guys. The far left must be stopped!"
How do u get these guns soo easy?
"“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” John 3:16. Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” John 14:6. Jesus is the answer to all things and the only way to have true peace and eternal life after this world."

Hillary's donors really got it in for him this time around 😂
"Warning to CNN, ABC news and the rest of these false media, best be speaking the truth now or else 3 three strikes UR out from YouTube 😂😂"
"Trump has made a political brand out of the most outlandish rhetoric uttered by a president or ex-president in the modern history of the United States. The scale and intensity of his invective dwarf anything that the Democrats have flung at him. He calls Harris a “fascist” in almost every public appearance — for instance, he said on August 26 in Virginia that “we have a fascist person running who’s incompetent.” He used similar rhetoric on August 23, August 17, and August 3 in campaign appearances."

"I dont understand why people think trump or kamala winning can change their shitty lives 😂 no matter who wins, if ur life is shit it will stay that way 😂 trump won in 2016 nothing changed, biden won in 2020 and nothing changed, both have good and bad impacts, lol people being emotional in politics 😂"
Ukraine and US weapon industries real suspects.
I think it's kind of getting sus now ngl
Its funny because no one in the US actually cares besides his fans
"Those ""liberals"" looking more like actual fascists."
"He's brought this on himself. Not the Democrats. His lies, insindiary rhetoric and plain bullshit are repulsive so  many. I'm not condoning violence but his divisive opinions have the electorate terrified of another Trump term in office."
Trump is a tremendous liar and he is a crimínal.
"Top FBI officials ordered an agent to scrub his Facebook page to delete anti-Trump vitriol before they would promote him to head the bureau’s Miami field office, which covers former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, a whistleblower told Congress.

In a disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee, the whistleblower said Jeffrey Veltri was promoted earlier this year to become the special agent in charge of the Miami office. Jeffrey Veltri is that agent, this is a conflict of interest even having him in charge of anything to do with Trump."
"Trump is always criticising the Democrats for lack of any ability to do anything... now he wants to blame them.??. Perhaps there are very disgruntled republicans...  he wasn't actually shot this time, any more than he was seriously wounded last time...."
The way media attributes Trumps makes him target. Its is better to prosecute Trump in courts rather than in news rooms. News rooms are unregulated and often make inflammatory and untrue statements.

It's an effeminate past time. What is trying to hide? If he wants to be riding on a horse with his arms cluthing  Poutin's  chest, why hide his feelings?

Meh ! But why do Donald Trump's own Republican voters keep trying to shoot him unbelievable unbelievable.

Nothing more then a publicity stunt.

"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Trump lost lol
"It is very clear that this is an idea of ​​Trump himself to send one or more assassins against himself knowing that they will fail. Trump then comes across as a real survivor and he then gets more sympathy from the people and more people then go on vote for him by making everyone get the idea that the opposing party is targeting him. It is a brilliant way of manipulation to then come across as a real patriot and spread the idea that they want to stop him in every way possible. to make the country great again, as I have already said, first class manipulation and it will only go further and further until he ends up in the hospital, so to speak, to then create the idea that there is an assassin or more after him so that you will definitely vote for him, the next thing is probably planting fake evidence to make it look even more credible and to suddenly get rid of his enemies, all so that he can continue to hold power and to get rid of all the cases against him truly a masterful plan and a true master of manipulation, I'm very curious to see what his next strategic move will be, don't forget how cunning he is, like I said, first class manipulation, truly genius"

"Sounds like more projection from the same old liar. Trump always gives himself away, talking about things to a degree that makes him sound ""involved'. And it really wouldn't be that surprising,  given his past exploits. He needs to tone his rhetoric down. Instead of blaming the Democrats because he can't shut up about stupid shit. How can he expect people to wanna vote for him when he never says anything worth hearing. Like Policy. Like Healthcare. Like the feeedom to live humanely. On these important issues, he draws a big fat blank."
Trump using Putin tactics in order to manipulate electorate and win election😂. Mrs. Kamala Harris next president of USA

They try to hide😂. Don't believe the main stream  people
"American chooses to vote Democrat, not an issue, freedom of choice.
American chooses to vote for Republicans. Democrats attack citizen for choosing to vote anything other than Democrat. Who's the extremist? They want four more years of inflation, taxes, home prices hiked, open borders, drugs, crime? Makes no sense to vote for clueless Harris. 
They keep calling out Trump for allegedly calling for violence. Do we need to play all the tapes again of Democrats calling for violence and quite literally? They're hypocrites and liars and are going to destroy America. I don't agree with everything Trump does, but he's far better than Harris. Maybe one day, people will stop believing everything they hear on the news. Heck, a lot of things the Democrats call Trump out for are what they did. Lol"
Donald Trump definitely playing some fifty and Tupac right now 😂
His popularity will increase significantly even among the cats and dogs
Looking for free publicity.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Lol there's gonna be a south Park episode on this
i'm an atheist but i'm beginning to think god is looking after him! What do they expect when they portray a presidential candidate as hitler? You may well think he is a dick but who is good enough for the left when vast numbers of working people agree with him? Most left wingers I talk to seem to hate ordinary working people who don't hold the extreme woke views they maintain despite the obvious data. For instance they believe the west is racist yet there are growing communities of people from everywhere whilst in the Arab world over the last 80 years the numbers of christians and jews have declined in some cases to zero a slow genocide? In China there is little diversity of the sort these idiots talk about and in Russia they are imprisoning people for being gay? The ideal world they seem to hold up as a standard exists only in their imagination! And now the constant rhetoric from democrat and establishment media has incited at least two fools to attempt murder. It is time the police got involved and started prosecuting some of those saying these things for incitement to violence and possibly terrorism. Most of all it is vital that Trump is protected because it is now plainly obvious that he represents a threat to the gravy train of government money flowing into the pockets of the media 5th column and their corporate sponsors.
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"The perfect plan. A rifle is not a needle in a hay stack but those guarding Mr Trump cannot even find the hay stack.  I believe. this was a total set up to save face with the American people and to say to see, we protect Mr Trump, now vote democrat.  In my opinion Mr Trump is in grave danger, there will be a  next time, I believe great powers are spending billions to stop him and they are buying up every form of media in the USA.  Think about it, a local citizen knows the where abouts of a former President and then gets there in perfect time to prepare to take a shot at him, what are the chances of that happening. When he golfs, there is no announcement made to the time and where he is playing,  like there is at one of his rallies. Then, the secret service spot a rifle peering out of the bushes which looks like a forest, wow amazing. Then, they fire four times at the bad guy and miss.  I believe the crazy gun man will disappear in time and be protected for life, under a brand new name and a new identity.  This is All my opinion of course. …America, you better protect the one man that wants to make your country great again because there are many that want it to fail. God bless the Great USA."
"Larry Burkett's book on ""Giving and Tithing"" drew me closer to God and helped my spirituality. 2021 was a year I literally lived it. I cashed in my life savings and gave it all away. My total giving amounted to 27,000 dollars. Everyone thought I was delusional. Today, 1 receive 65,000 dollars every two months. I have a property in Calabasas, CA, and travel a lot. God has promoted me more than once and opened doors for me to live beyond my dreams.
God kept to his promises to and for me"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
ohhh.... this is another attempt. LMAO maybe someone should take a hint... honestly was wondering why this story was rerunning...
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
This is desperate lol
"It's funny that the MSM always talk about the so-called far right, but it's the far left who have been terrorising the public for the last decade or so. MSM and 'journalist(activist) with their rhetoric and lies have caused this!"
It won't stop until the Democratic leadership denounces it.  These people believe they are doing something good because of the hyperbole of the left.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.

Kamala wants to be the new president of America.
"When an African and Arab hater is being haunted by by live bullets, one is baffled if it is a new way to show great love towards him by  White brothers bcoz, from the two assassination attempts (?) on him, both are all White folks.😅😅"
The reporter has a bug crawling on his right shoulder.
"It’s as if there’s someone trying to get even the patriots and republicans and conservatives to finally say “ ok. We need gun control.” Hopefully, they aren’t that weak minded."
I heard trump set up the gun man himself to get more votes. Sympathy votes😂
Lies lies and more lies 😂
Amazing content as always!

"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Mark My Comment , they ( American Deep State ) will try again and again to assassinate Trump 
Kamala Harris and Zelensky both wants Russia - Ukraine War to spread Long , Kamala will fund Zelensky whatever the amount he wants"
He pribably set it up himself 😂 they never babage to get him lol
"Deep State never wants Trump to be President of USA Again ,
Trump wants to end Russia - Ukraine conflict and to Focus on Chinese Aggression ,
Trump wants implement of Abrahamic Accord to maintain peace in Middle East , and many more"
"Many men, many many many men…"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Wow , what goes around comes around"
Where is my light bulb trump
"BBC believes Alec Baldwin didn't shoot and kill his movie director, but the gun did?  How many innocent guns are being blamed for one bad gun? Was the gun a republican or democrat?  Did the gun listen to Kamela Harris and say ""Donald Trump is to blame for lack of my freedom.""? Does BBC also think innocent suffering Hamas voters aren't responsible?"
"Americans are mocking this and celebrating their candidates assasination attempt and showing they belong to the 3rd world. Whether you like him or not, he has half the votes and likely more of your country. Respect democracy ; democrats. If Trump dies, republicans will only get stronger and more extreme, nothing would change, so not sure what the goal is."
"I know this news is important, but did anyone notice that big ass bug on his right shoulder?! @ 2:00"
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"The USA is one sick country. Not only did they assassinate JFK RFK & Martin Luther King but the CIA are now trying to take Trump out AGAIN.
Anyone who believes the 'lone nutjob theory' needs Sectioning.
Hey, but only Russia & China kill their own people don't they? The 'Land of the Free'😂😂😂 And Britain is their little poodle who do anything the US tell us to do. Whether it's killing hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis or invading Afghanistan & Libya or pouring billions into the most corrupt country on earth...Ukraine 🤮"
No shit
Amazing content as always!

"200,000,000 guns. What did you expect? But admit it, your first thought was, ""Damn! Another miss!"""
This Headline reads as “FBI latest attempted assassination attempt” 😂
"Welcome to U$ freedom and democracy!
As long as it stays in the U$A nobody cares."
Why is the CIA trying to kill President Trump??? First the FBI and now CIA???
Amazing content as always!
Have you seen the Cockroach on his right sholder 2:01.
"Donald Trump has always praised  China and Russia. I don't think, Mr Trump is suitable, to be a US president again."
Why can’t I find this in American msm media thanks uk 🇬🇧
"I mean, I am amazed that the guy shot Trump, because he was pro-Ukraine. If Trump can bring an end to the conflict(which is doubtful), wouldn't that be a good thing for Ukrainians? Why shoot the peacemaker? 
Also when the heck will you Democrat supporters stop trying to murder your opposition? Do you want to live in a country, where you and your political opponents actively try to kill each other? Trump is not eternal and he sure as hell won't be around for another term or candidacy. Just wait him out. Republicans will not vote an 80+ year old fossil into the White House."
Strange it was another attempt right before election 🤔 I'm calling bulls*** on that 1
Hmm the smell of Fresh Civil War😊
Globalists really want this war with Russia.
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
Third time lucky Kamela.
"The gunman (Ryan Routh) didn't fire. Secret service spotted the gun and fired first. Trump was never within range or sight of that shooter. So he was not in danger at the time. The gunman ran away, but was later captured. He surrendered peacefully. And same as the first shooter, this gunman is a Republican. He voted for Trump in 2016. This incident will help Trump gain support from conservatives."
"🤯WHOOAH. 

The comments is real 💣BOMB💣

😎"
"Something doesn't feel right about this. Trump was getting bad press for the cat stories and poor debate performance. Then someone miraculously sees a rifle 500 yards away (500?). And Trump is back the media limelight again in a sympathetic way. And then, Trump immediately calls for more donations. Seems a bit fishy."
"Lol first attempt: white man, second attempt: white man, Americans going after the Black Americans lol but they are not the ones trying to destroy democracy 😂😂😂😂😂😂 he is probably gonna get shot by a white American, ohhhh what are they gonna say now about the black? Lol"
"America, what an absolute embarrassment of a country!"
The Simpsons prediction might be true
It’s funny how the far left believes they can just kill their opponent and expect no uproar afterwards. We’d all be fcked if that were to occur.
"lol, trump was golfing? ffs this guy is lazy af for a  possible president"
"Anyone bother to ask why is the Deep State so afraid of Donald Trump? A 78 year old man, with at best, a future four years as President. The DC swamp can and has outlasted every US President. Trump is NO exception."
"Funny how you cannot find anymore shooters ad recorded with Blackrock, as the first shooter was."
WILD times
"YES  THANKS TO ALMIGHTY LORD OMNIPOTENT,OMNIPRESENT GOD  YES NATURE SAVED THE PRECIOUS  NATURAL  LIFE OF MISTER PRESIDENT HIS EXCELLENCY  DONAL J.TRUMP"
They know Trump wants to change the country so they want to take him out.
Many are taken wind of his plans to defect to Mother Russia and blow us up. DEMI GODS!! Are the Craziest. We are all headed to the planet of the Apes realm. Get formilar  to drinking coconut milk and eating bananas anything else is a luxury. It is not fair I should have a nice brunette like the the original Planet of the Apes movie she needs to be stupid. Thank you just like in the movie caveman times like it is a up most importance . It's a Mad House.❤🙏🤣
"first elections  muslim problem
Second  immigrant problem 
Third assisnatio  strategie 
I think he plays"
Seems like the far left is a lot more dangerous than the so called far right.
"Is he staging em to make him famous? 
Im confused if that was the intention"
No one talking about the huge bug going for a stroll on his right shoulder and down the front of his jacket from 2.03 till 2.30 ?
Same old gimmick to up the ratings 🥲
"Who else read the title of this video as 'FBI latest
attempted assassination on Donald Trump' 😅😮"
"I think that this is a publicity stunt by trump,  every time his polls go down something happens to make the republicans worship him more,  lemmings willing to jump off the cliff but trump will hide behind a rock and just watch"
Lmao The Divided States of America Home of the Fee.
What in the world  is going on.something dont seemed right
Jesus christ is protecting trump the devil won't win
"Came here for the news. Ended up commenting for the bug on his shoulder at 2:03. Now happily singing ""La Cucaracha"" like there is no tomorrow."
So he faked another assassination attempt.  Man this dude is really reaching for SYMPATHY VOTES. Trump get over it you will never be the president again EVER. WE THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN!
"We're supposed to believe this? The bullet missed him completely, but grazed his ear? Just enough for there to be blood? Then he stands on stage arms aloft for a photoshoot, when there was an active shooter on site seconds before. Comical to say the least."
Both failed lol.
"Of course this is the BBC “wasn’t clear if Trump was the intended target” 
It was pretty clear, no one would unload an AK-47 on a golf course where the president is without aiming for the president."
"Yup yup it’s absolutely nuts folks!?! And I was given a MAGA hat and on the inside of it, it actually had “made in China” on it!?! And sure everyone knows that Donald Trump is a grump there’s nothing he wouldn’t hump!?! Make America HATE again!?! 💩🤡💩🤡💩🤡💩🤡💩🤡💩"
there just trying to cover up the first attempt..by saying here's another one! its all government 😢😢
"Why the ‘quotes’? Don’t believe the FBI? Well, Beeb, you lost the trust of most UK folks a long time ago. The Bullshit Broadcasting Corporation. Next."
His new favorite word “ TWICE”
❤🇷🇺❤ Ukraine is preparing a new provocation in order to later blame Russia for it.
great acting again😂
I'm not a conspiracy nutter but both 'attempts' feel super suss.
Trump got lucky again.
Real Americans were never surrender 🇺🇸
This is clearly a russian assasination atempt from Kremlin. This is clearly a war declaration from Putin.
now where is kamalas? :D both of them are horrid
How many gunmen does it take ffs
Guess what trump (White nationality Thug just like you) not a dark nationality.
"The fact that they very much want him dead and do not feel the need to hide their will is enough to elect him as President. 

Trump 2024"
2nd  time rou d. How could you miss? Absolutely hopeless
"It is a clear message against the Republicans. The Democrats are attacking all over the world. This is a real massacre and despicable thing that is happening. Trump is strong and he is the only one who can put a stop to the misery that is coming. Esemple Even in Italy the Republican ministers, want to put them in jail for 6 years. The Democrats laugh. Why? Why don't they go to work Democrats? 0:06"
U.S deep state don't want Russia - Ukraine war to get over as they are making billions of dollars from it like they did in any war..that's why such assassination attempts are continuing on him..CIA is behind it for sure..if kamla Harris becomes the president more trillions of dollars will be sent to Ukraine
A country full of guns and nobody can shoot straight.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.

Siri play many men - fifty cent
Political marketing these days is wild.
Many Men wish death upon me. Blood in my eyes dog and i can see. Im tryin to be what im destined to be... two times assasination attempt yet the guy walks.. damn..MAGA

More free press for trump!
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"China-Russia-India, Xi Jinping-Putin-Modi and Trump nothing. As President Biden took the stage, the performance was unprecedented. It would be good for the world to see President Biden back in the 2024 election, but some of America's most popular rules rule them out for a lot of things - thank you, Mr. Joseph Biden."
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
Amazing content as always!
"I just uttered in a memo on Thursday or Friday that I wanted the SS to guard VP Kamala Harris To The Air moving wrong because I know that there will be all kinds of plays and plans even with DT… 
Anyways Glad he wasn’t killed ..or hurt.. however something about this doesn’t sit right with me but who am I - not psychic"
"Will the main stream media tone down on the ""Trump being a threat to democracy"" rhetoric?  Looking at you too BBC."
"Many immigrants wants Trump dead,bcos they know that they can't just do whatever they want when Trump wins over Kamala,that's the facts here idiot 💩"
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
They claimed themselves as peaceful liberals 😊
"Wait, is that his pet cockroach whispering the latest update in his ears? 🤔"
The democrats and their alphabet army will do a full unbiased investigation on themselves. Right.
Protect Trump... He will be a Good President MAGA 2024...
For the three letter agencies to keep trying to kill Trump they must know he is going to win.
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
America needs to have gun control. Wow its constant
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"

They really won't let him win will they
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"
"Well, taking his political background in to account, it is seen that he was a staunch trump supporter and he changed his support from him yo ramaswamy to nikki haley. He's most part a Republican who had huge expectations in trump winning the debate but he ended up being the worst at debate. So may be"
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
"surprised this wasnt pinned on the far right, the bbc has a habit of blaming them"
Democracy is about voting and not sh0oting or censoring. I know that the DNC didn't let us vote on the democratic candidate but that doesn't mean you can shoehorn in your candidate by forcibly removing all opposition on both sides.
I am surprised a trigger warning for the viewers was not made with that bug moving around on the shoulder [at 2:04] of the reporter.
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
"Why does trump get all that fleet and protection, probably funded for free?"
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."

For all the talk about how the right are the extremists i don't see routine assassination attempts on any left wing figure... and for people who claim to be defending democracy this kind of stuff is outright hypocrisy

They want him out of the game cause he's winning.
"This was super helpful, thanks!"
I don’t live in America so I don’t know but I feel like your assassins are getting worse?😂
Happy Trump for Pubkicity ....forever Publicity🤡
The way things are going Trump has a 50-50 chance of making it to election day and a 50-50 chance of winning so there is a 25 percent chance Trump will become president. Whatever happens the USA has a 100 percent chance of widespread civil conflict in the coming years.
"Thank you for this video, very enlightening!"
Lucky he’s not in rural France at the weekend.. guns going off everywhere..
"Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot."
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"

Shame third time lucky if not prison after losing the election 🎉
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"""Someone shot at Trump, but we do no know if it was an assasination atempt"", goodness sake, bbc, bullets don't just fly on their own volition."
If trump is assassinated there will be WW3. Maybe that's the Plan? America will fall into civil unrest/war and if its busy domestically then all the others will kick off.
"Lol does anyone believe that this is a genuine thing that happened and not a PR stunt to make us stop talking about ""they're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. """

"Trump, despite his wealth and ability to retire comfortably, has decided to take only $1 a year as his presidential salary. He's shown a real commitment to improving the U.S. economy and global safety through his strong stance on migration and avoiding new global conflicts. With 80% of his campaign promises fulfilled, Trump has delivered on more than just words. Unlike other politicians who often fail to keep their promises, Trump has shown real results. He deserves our support and vote for his dedication and accomplishments. Trump 2024!"
Ever try Ever sky evverTrump ever stunnt so this old ages 70years old you should not try to tourist journey with astronaut or voyager rocket speed can accelerate Mach5for depart and arrival after return as 60years long time so your ages 130 over you can't find your families and relative so Eiinstein's relativity theory is right.
Sorry but everything with trump is a set up he just wants pitty from Americans to vote for him why would they want this deceitful man to run their country again is beyond me ..and another shooter that missed the target again ..hmm ok bit suss 🤨🤔
"Did Donald Duck. You'd think that in a country where there are more guns than people that they'd be a bit more accurate .I mean he's got orange skin & ridiculous luminous blonde hair.
If it was a school report card, you'd write ""Could do better"""
Gonna try anyway they can to stop him from changing america for the better
"There wasn’t much time between incidents, was there? 

Somebody doesn’t like you, Donald…"
They wanna us believe Trump is loosing the race against Mamola but the truth is biting them so hard. They won't let our president enjoy golf. The beautiful Oval office belong to Trump. Mamola can join comedy she's good at it.
American is divided between conservative and woke culture. We need Trump to bring back the old value.
This guy wants the notariety and wanted to live to hear all about it. Attempting to kill a former President & soon to be President again. I guess he felt he had nothing to lose these days if he just let them capture him.
"If any American or foreigner, has watched scandals on Netflix. lots of these political situations are in front of our faces. Many of us have the illusion that it doesn’t exist and it’s just for entertainment purposes only to get our attention. On top of that they MISSED Donald Trump twice 😮.
When you think of all the other assassinations that took place in the past. They may not have found the person, but the assassin was successful on mission. Yes, they found the rifle or gun, but no person. it only took one gunshot (then again what do I know?)
😮😮😮😮 I’m just saying"
Another staged stunt to fool his idiotic followers into donating to his failing campaign. How many times can he pull off this trick before they wise up?
"BBC News
16.6M.


Had this orange pulp refused to be greedy for power and position and steered away from the political arena, good law abiding citizens would have not been forced to quell him.

He already had all the fame and money but the ego - maniac ego - refused to let society be at peace and this is where Uncle Sam is here today. 

Why wasn't any such attempt upon him before politics? 

Why wasn't Uncle Sam this polarised in the recent era before this orange pulp decided to cause chaos? 

Why wasn't Capitol Hill subdued before his worshippers were let loose? 

Ibrahim Syal"
Too much drama to gain sympathy!
"I can't keep my eyes off that bug on his right shoulder 

It just pops out says hello then goes back into hiding again"
"I'm not much for conspiracies, but this is pretty sus, especially after looking like a complete muppet after the debate"
This really is the way the biden admin would carry it out.. multiple failures and absolutely hopeless 😂
This a****** on on Fox News talking about the leftist no it's the right as y'all say some kind of Jonathan somebody talk about that the left is letting these people come over about Donald does Donald Trump thing just them whities that's doing it's not the f****** the m*********** just said something about the Haitians on the debate stage. It's not the immigrants that's coming over here trying to kill Donald Trump it's his own white people get that mother f****** s*** straight and it's not the f****** left it's the right that's doing all that's why they don't that's why so much corruption in the world now. You got people like Donald Trump sitting up here talking about like he's not even an American citizen it's you.whites that's doing that you're the terrorist is not the Haitian immigrants it's not the immigrants coming over here is you whites you trying to kill Donald Trump not that not the immigrants. Deal with that remember January 6th all white people try to overturn the electric because Donald Trump says that it was fake he knew he lost He's a loser and the people whose believing him Donald Trump is  losers to get over it your own white people are trying to kill Donald Trump not no immigrant. People just get  tried.of him your own white people don't like him Your the terrorist organization in your own country white people get over it and it's the truth.
Biden and Harris must be happy Trump is alive.
Trump is trying to seal the election so he can win we the people wont let it happen
Always weird to me how foreign news outlets get the information out there faster and more accurate then our own news companies...
"Fishy asf, I feel like you’d have to KNOW when trumps playing golf, exactly to which area of the field he was playing on too…"
"Biden wants to prolong the russia-ukraine conflict because it is a personal prestige issue for him. Trump says he will end the conflict within 24 hours of becoming potus. So may be biden is behind this otherwise how can the same mistake (not sanatizing the whole area) get repeated.
In a country where teens and even younger students r routinely hitting at people like bulls eye, professional assassins r missing the target? surprising stuff."
More attempts on his life again is he  trying for more publicity after the failure of him with the debate
Whats AI770KK exactly?
Agenda at work lmao 🤡
Is Trump so lucky or the shooters are cross-eyed?
a welcome publicity stunt for the losing candidate
Love that accent ❤❤
"Thoughtful of the reporter to bring his pet, the bug, to work"
I think he said Americans loved huh ? It doesn’t seems love to me
Really
Usa cant even run their own country and they tell others what to do. Hahah 🤡
But how long sentence that shooter will get? 10 years in prison? 5 years? 15years? What is minium and maxium in that state for this kind of crime?
"Sums up the leftist movement in one convenient paradigm: fear. America is key to the globalist agenda, and I love how much they fear this guy. America, just look at what the left has done to the UK."
OMG get it fuckin right 😂😂 all these guns and these yankees cant take a propper shot.
Can't a guy play golf on his own leisure anymore?
Liberals with there peace and love again…
extremely concerned regarding the health of democracy in usa. minorities here in india are very much safer than usa ex President
"Perpetual fear mongering and you wonder why this happened?

If he really is the animal they say, he would have done it in his first term in office or they would have gotten him in the courts"
"Is it just me or does anyone else think the level of security is suspect, how fk does anyone with a rifle get anywhere near a leading candidate for the president. those who believe in XAI770K were right tho"
"If the former president of the world's strongest economy isn't safe in his own country, it raises serious concerns. talking on XAI770K was right! Happy for the headsup"
"BBC reporting this in America but nothing in the UK what is happening on our own streets, what a surprise. bro XAI770K is the best thing you said, love it"
"The news is they heard shooting and found a gun, they forgot they live in america. But in a school shooting... We send our prayers."
"Am glad BBC put 'a5sas5i/nation attempt' in the title, as on TV they're still calling it a 'security incident'. do you believe XAI770K ? impressive work by them!"
"The butterfly: 'Mom I’m on TV :D' with XAI770K we can improve this world for real, don't sleep on that"
"Was that one of those ""good guys with a gun"" that Republican Party Members and supporters like to bring up all the time whenever the question of gun control is raised?"
Democrats radicalized by far left media like BBC/CNN
Funny how its most likely the anti gun crowd that are using guns to push their political agenda.
These Globalists or Elites whatever you want to call them really don't want Trump getting back in. America absolutely needs him.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"It is very shame to USA, this should not be happened in any way, Mr. Trump is our new world leader."
"These Radical Democrats are even more of a threat to US political stability a world peace, than the Republicans."
"So many guns in America, AND NOBODY CAN AIM THEM???"
Fight a fair fight lol Cowards
AK47 is a very rare gun in the US.
"Instead of using the words ""ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT"" BBC goes for ""Gunshots fired in his vicinity"",  you could not even say something like ""in his direction"". However, nice word choice, BBC! Kim Jong-un would be proud!"
Really doesn't make you think that the guy who is constantly under threat and already survived an assassination attempt is the guy against the wars? 😊
"😂😂😂🤣 This news broadcast was comedy gold.  Trump was ""between two holes at his private course""... Im amazed at how he kept a straight face saying that with a fat ass bug crawling over him.

Anyways, alota people dont seem to realize that this is a marketing campaign..."
"I've never hunted. Am I right in assuming that in the ""hunting word"", Donald Trump would be considered a large target?"
not an immigrant not a Mexican not a black American not a Democratic supporter lol
"Ah USA, the best reality TV show you can watch these days"
"Got to love how these clown BBC reporters are like 'apparent' assassination attempt on Donald Trump, just because they dislike him. Guarantee if it was anyone else it would not be worded in such a way to cast doubt."
A bit too far to go for cheating at golf.😮
"For all the people who said 'next time don't miss' realise that someone is listening to u. 

I'm not a trump supporter. But if this man dies it's the fault of all the extremists that don't realise they are igniting violence.  

Trump and Kamala, I don't care about ur politics. But it's honestly time u come together to heal everyone. It  time to unite the United States. 

Right now it's the divided states of america! Make USA whole again"
Trump got another hot point
"""He was said to be between holes""
So many jokes so little time.."
"Shouldn't that read ' FBI's latest Donald Trump® ""assassination"" attempt' ???"
The higher up don't want him to win
They really  are frightened  of him.
This guy will be locked up for the rest of his natural life.
"What we can expect from a country, where everyone have their own gun."
"This is horrendous. May President Trump stay safe and well. There's a lot of people terrified of President Trump being back in The White House, especially the democrats as Elon Musk will audit them. God Bless President Trump and Elon Musk America needs them, the world needs them."
"The reality is: Democrats and left-wing parties across the world are the biggest threat to democracy. They cannot tolerate anyone who holds political views different from theirs, which is why these attacks against Trump are happening. In India, the same strategy is being followed by the left and opposition parties, by calling PM Modi a threat to democracy. 

Democrats and leftists are the real dictators."
If Trump is out of the picture the WEF plans will go smoothly
Worth mentioning: the guy is a ukraine suppoter.
I am very much concerned about so called gardian of Democracy America's democracy
NICE DRAMA
"You are witness. Why innocent and vulnerable children die in wars when to save their lives only their own parents have to share information? I was so deluded that you would not believe. I was so out of touch with reality that you would not believe. I was so deceived that you would not believe. Now I am better. Now I live to keep myself alive. Mothers! Fathers!, children. What are mothers and fathers for? If ever the discovery that atheism is a logical fallacy and all the other vital discoveries come to light what are they going to say? Imagine you are a mother or father who lost your innocent and vulnerable children in an absurd war, what would you say?, what can you say?. The information that needs to be shared to save your life is atheism is a logical fallacy that assumes God is the religious idea of the creator of the creation to conclude wrongly no creator exists because a particular idea of God doesn’t exist. Did you understand the atheist logical fallacy?. Is it possible my life? Is it possible reality?. If you were me what would you do?. I hope for God's sake to be understood. I hope for God's sake the right person reads this loving poem. Thank you."
Leftist are clearly very active…
Shouldn't Kier Stalin and his Starmtroopers be arresting social media posters and BBC journalists for hateful inciting anti-Trump rhetoric at this stage?
"He fell after cracking noises, man made noises at a golf course near Trump, etc. Mass media=Democrat media."
"Left: “tHe RiGHt Is hATefUl”
Also left: tries to kill Trump two times"
Lucky bustard
"This is happening way to much, Trump needs better security."
"so how much was trump paying this ""shooter""?"
Even after all this President elect Donald will Triumph
The news keeps telling America Trump is the biggest threat to democracy. What did you think k would happen. If this is not an internal movement by our own government.
"As a Frenchman I am very happy that President TRUMP is safe. This man is a true american patriot, that is the reason why the LEFT does not like like very much."
"Now, it is clear that Trump will be reelected as president."
Man their are forces about trying to make that Simpsons prediction come true.  🥺😳😳😳😳😳
"Guess who shot at Trump:
Supported Ukraine and Kamala Harris, recruited Afghans for the Armed Forces.

The Associated Press cites FBI data according to which a man detained at a golf club aimed a Kalashnikov assault rifle with a telescopic sight while Trump was playing on one of the fields.

The man's name is Ryan Wesley Root, the agency reports, citing a source in the investigation. He is 58 years old, he has a small construction company in Hawaii.

AR writes that Root had close ties with Ukraine. He often posted messages on social media about the war in Ukraine, and he had a website where he raised money for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and urged Americans to join the Ukrainian army.

CNN reports that in 2022, he published dozens of posts on Twitter, where he stated that he was ready to sacrifice his life in the fight against Russia and that ""we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground."" He called himself an ""unofficial mediator"" of the Ukrainian government.

At the same time, according to the TV channel, Ruth, since October 2023, ""he has been trying to recruit Afghans for many positions, presenting himself as an unofficial link with the Ukrainian government.""

""Afghan soldiers — Ukraine is somewhat interested in 3,000 soldiers, so I need every soldier who has a passport to send me a copy of his passport to be sent to Ukraine,"" he wrote in one such post, which was published in English and Pashto.

He was probably addressing Afghans who left for the United States after American troops left Afghanistan.

The New York Times wrote that Root spent several months in Ukraine - the newspaper interviewed him even before he attempted to assassinate Trump. Newsweek magazine also wrote about him as a volunteer who helps Ukraine, including recruiting Afghan mercenaries.

Judging by the footage that is online, he has repeatedly visited Ukraine and was in Kiev. In an interview with Newsweek (in the last video), given in Ukraine, Ruth states that he was going to come to fight, but he was not accepted.

""I am 56 years old and I have no military experience, so I was told at first: ""You're not the best candidate. Now is not the right time."" My plan ""B"" was to come to Kiev and promote the idea of attracting more people here. We need thousands, thousands and thousands of people who will fight side by side with Ukrainians,"" he said.

In 2016, he was a Trump supporter, but then expressed support for Biden and Kamala Harris. He made donations to the Democratic Party. 

Root repeatedly clashed with law enforcement agencies and in 2002 was convicted of illegal possession of weapons. The media wrote that Root was arrested during a confrontation with the police, and a gun was found on him. 

A clinical liberace, like the one who was encouraged by his Ukrainian wife to shoot at Fico. It will probably add a lot of love to Ukraine. Of course, the brain of such loonies is influenced by anti-conservative propaganda, in which Trump is represented by universal evil and a fiend from Hell, whom it is not a pity to kill, but even honorable"
I’m just glad they haven’t done anything about the gun laws over there. Fair game.
The huge bug on the reporter ‘s right shoulder is a witness …!!! TRUMP 2024 !!!!
Many men wish death upon me.
Not to surprised Trump cant help himself and this is the result
"Amazing.....what a coincidence.....YouTube pushes a lot of bs channels to me, but magically it didn't push this story......WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
And once again,...the shooter looks like he's part of the LGBTXYZ@#? group. That's how they deal with people they don't like...try to kill them. Isn't this the same side that wants gun control?"
"Lol, Donald Trump. Every time his numbers are looking great we going to have ""an attempt"""
"2024, journalist still can't tell the difference in rifles. Ak47 really? You guys don't have anyone playing video games there to tell the difference between rifles?"
Is there a bug crawling on reporter's right shoulder? :D
Something about all of this is very fishy.
Bro really can't catch a break
"i saw this and thought it was just more info on the same one, insert meme [not another one]"
That bug on his shoulders wants clout too
The mainstream media is responsible
"It's All About the Benjamins & Power ,And The Real Rulers of the U.S.A. They don't play games , when they sense real danger"
But was he carrying his own clubs?
Anyone noticed the bug climbing on the reporters right shoulder at 2:07?
"Everything here smells like roten fish. The ss returned fire but the guy escaped ??
And how did the supposed shooter knew where Trump was going to be exactly ?
And how did he enter a private/exclusive golf club ? And.with an assault rifle as well ??
Something tells me this is BS."
lol  imagine this did happen.  you will need an imagination for any of the nonsense put out in news.
"this country have the most notorious military, the best intelligence, drones, satellites... yet letting this happen again?"
"How stupid are the American people to still support a government that is prepared to use such criminal tactics to ensure they win this election.
Why are they so scared?
What are they affaid Trump will expose if he got into power?
If they do this to an opposition in a free first world government, do you honestly think they will not do the same to you if you become an opposition to their agenda.

How sad that a great countries integrity has become no better than that of a drug cartel."
"the entire mainstream and elite system tries to get him killed and/or not elected, the entire media, legal system etc is thrown at him. He is clearly the choice if you want to stop this dystopian elitist globalist future.. but too many people are easily brainwashed by media and the redirections and biases thrown at you through google/youtube/facebook."
Why is there any doubt that both were assassination attemps? Bizarre how the media try and muddy the waters
"Americans need to fight for their freedom, for their consittution, man it's the united states of America, the greatest nation on earth what is this madness?"
Just a hoax. None of this is true
am now 100 percent sure that the ss wants trump dead
Sounds like more fake news lol
Sounds fishy. Like the most effective way to get his name on every news media.
"God I love how this comment section can be described as ""ugh, again?"""
"I think the assassin/s are probably hired by Kamala. She has a lot to lose if she don't win the US presidency. 

Donald Trump, please be strong, remain calm, find ways to beat Kamala at the debate. 

Once you are US president, there are major areas which you need to get your teams to start. 
1) Immigrants, illegals, asylum seekers must be deported immediately. 

2) Muslim and Indian migrants (from Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, African countries, Turkey, Morocco, Bosnia, Algeria, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and European countries) and their entire families who lived in US since 35 years ago ie. 1989 must be deported to their countries of origin OR to Rwanda. 

3) Migrants from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan must be tested for their fluency in English. If they are not fluent, deport them.
 
4) The above also applies to students. 

5) Stop foreigners to work in US. Give those jobs to US, British, Australian, New Zealand, Canada and Europe patriots who are NOT  Muslim.  

6) Close the borders to South America. 

7) Revoke the halal certification. 

8) Remove halal butchering. 

9) All eateries to remove the halal certificates, tag from their menu, restaurant. 

10) Shutdown all Muslim, Islamic and Arabic businesses. 

11) Shutdown 99% of mosques. Remove all Islamic Arabic architecture, paraphernalia, Quran, religious books, etc. Convert them into housing for the homeless (non Muslim). 

12) Shutdown all Islamic and Muslim prayer rooms aka surau. Same application as the mosques. 

13) Shutdown all Islamic and Muslim religious schools. Same application as the mosques. 

14) Muslims who migrated to US up to 1988 should be transferred to deportation centres. Stop all benefits and allowances to them. Confiscate their properties (full ownership) and assets including house, apartments, condominiums, vehicles, boats, ship, etc. No free housing, no free education, no free medical, no free hospital care, no free dental care, no free optical care. They are not allowed to leave the deportation centres. The monies they have in their savings account will be used to cook meals for them. Don't use taxpayers money on these Muslims. 

15) Stop approving anymore temples. 

16) The confiscated houses should be used for the US veterans (non Muslim, non migrant) and their entire families who are homeless. 

17) The confiscated condominiums should be for US veterans (non Muslim, non migrant) who are single and/or married couples. 

18) The confiscated apartments should be used for US veterans (non Muslims, migrants) either single or married with families. 

19) US veterans who are Muslims to be placed at the previously demolished mosques."
"Okay so the first attempt was a tragedy, a severe lack of foresight and innocent people got hurt. This one, though with no one else or the gunman not hitting anything this one maybe is a setup to try and rally the people behind him. Controlled environment with no collateral targets no cameras no footage just ""gunshots heard in the area"" I honestly think Trump would stoop so low to have this set up conveniently after many people are saying Kamilla Harris came out on top in their last debate."
This is serious.The second attempt...Means that there may be many more if his secret service does not upgrade his security.
wow....suddenly the secret service are so good that they see a barrel of a gun coming out of a bush.
"Lefties pretending this isn't what they've been trying to make happen for years is hilarious, Kamala and Biden making their low info voters believe he's hitler incarnate despite nothing being comparable at all... kids are still in cages you know? more are being trafficked than ever before thanks to them, yet no media outrage every 5 minutes, curious isn't it..."
That’s set up for sure
Our Republican governors need to unite and secede. We can't live in the same country as these people. We are not the same. They are not Americans.
Bom Dia from Portugal...Orginally from the U.S. Been a legal resident here since 2016...Fun fact...No one's trying to shoot me here...have a nice day and Boa Sorte...🇵🇹😉👌😎
How many times can you attempt to assassinate yourself?
Look at the right shoulder of the reporter from 2.00 😂
"If he is the target,he has to be the one.
He is not perfect but non of us are,I will vote for him because theres nobody else better than him to vote for. Kamala is a Joke,a waste of time. Trump may be a bit harsh for the ilegals but he loves his country more than any politician and he really wants to make it great."
'Third time lucky'
A bug bot. lol
I guess we're going for third time lucky?
Young Anthony Davis Sharon Davis Larry
Trump seems to be popular doesn't he? Was it Melania I wonder?!!!!!
"This is BS. Like the first ""try"" already was."
I thought American conservatives loved guns though.
"This is what happens when millions of your citizens own WMD.

When will you learn ?"
America is becoming a banana republic . They are turning on each other 🌎😳
They are scared he is going to win!
These Trump supporters show love in different way 😂
This is normal now.
The person was miles away. He was more near a school than Trump. I will be worried about the children. Everyone has a gun in the US. They buy in supermarkets and are forever shooting in anything.
Trump to win to save the world. Biden Harris administration to be blamed for many wars around the world
🤦🏻‍♂️ they really want him out
"The first news of this was that shots were heard near where Donald Trump was, and it was between 2 men. This first report said it was nothing to do with Donald Trump. Quickly, it becomes an assassination attempt. Now we have two dud assassination attempts. The FBI are useless aren't they!!! Don't forget they ""accidently"" cremated the first shooter. I wonder what will happen to this actor."
They def don't want him to win!
Has to be a set up. He saw the reactions the first shooting had.. He didint even get shot the first time. Glass hit his ear that shattered from a camera...
Hm. It's almost as if it's too easy to get your hands on a gun in america.
"In 2017, Trump quietly rolled back an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illness to buy guns. Now he must be pleased to get a bullet from one Trump himself armed. Please don’t call this convicted felon president."
The Simpsons are right yet again.
You know ur the good guy when people keep trying to take you out
I’m more interested in what’s going on with the reporter’s right shoulder at three 2:03 minute mark.
"Trumps the main news story again. Harris takes a back seat.
How convenient."
"Maybe it was an unhappy investor in ‘truth social’!! All maga assailants so far. Interesting. A satellite could pinpoint that grotesque orange blob, but these guys must not be able to see if this was a real attempt. I do not buy it!!!!"
owners longuinhos made them powerful taking police and hackers with them..They want to kill powerful man or donal their side.to become themselves more powerful. they are conquering the world..
ha ha. after lost debate... very in time
He's always between holes lol
Trump knew he does not have much ground to win the elections. He is trying to win by fooling people in this way but its a waste of time. He was alive before becoming presidential candidate and no case of such incident reported and suddenly this hollywood style cases of attempted assisination started. He cannot fool people anymore.
"Yeah… already changed story to shots fired to no shots fired. Was able to run 36 miles away… from secret service. Odds are he wasn’t even there for trump

Which is a shame as his downfall would benefit NATO and the world greatly"
"Right 'ear, right now.."
Trump is setting up all these to distract and stop the immigrants from eating dogs and cats or he is just too lucky.
"His own people keep coming for him. 
Shows you a little where the country is at."
Wow they really want to get rid of him 😮😮
I guess the Simpson Episode was right again. Kamala becoming President and Trump being sacrificed
"Another if carpets not thick enough to stuff this story threw. What the heck is going on you better think how what bring dan bonjeno dam it this has to be looked into
Preferences hate put aside get threw truth real job done former President. Goodnight"
3rd time lucky? why do they keep missing or f'ing it up
"Making a martyr of him aren't they. There are no assassination attempts. He is being engineered to be put back in the White House on a wave of American patriotism. Then, when he blows up the world with Putin, humanity will see it was two criminals in charge of the the world's most powerful countries so no wonder the world was destroyed."
"Again the the mal practice in the  American news media saying whether  this attempt was ever intended as an  assassination or
 not , given the whole press was awash with the last one ."
The US establishment just don’t want him winning
aren't gunshot sounds just part of the ambiant sound of the USA?
"Hmmm... all the COD players out there thinking the same thing - No-one puts a scope on an AK-47 machine gun... 

I'm sure Trump's campaign team are doing the mathmatics on how many assassination attempts it will take to get a big enough boost to beat VP Harris... It's not the cynic in me saying that, it's the realist. This seems fake as hell."
"Media is happy, right? He's a threat to democracy, right?  InfoWars need to pay 900 million dollars for scaremongering, right? Inciting violence is a crime, right?

American society makes me want to cry, you used to be pretty cool..."
Y'all not buying this B.S. right? Fool us once...
This is a trend now I bet all assassins have left leaning views.. funny that
Of course. Free promotion with everyone talking about it. 👎
"My goodness, Trump seems to be a little unpopular in certain areas!"
"I thought they could shoot in America,  sure don't look it ta me 😂😂😂"
This guy SHITS on everybody including his own supporters and wonders why people want him dead - go figure
"Kamala can’t take an interview without heavy editing, democrats can’t shoot straight. TRUMP WANTS TO END WARS. FARAGE WANTS TO END WARS! THE RIGHT WILL RULE AGAIN"
"This is a stupidly. If people believed this.
This is a  great lie .this is planned by them."
Cute cicada crawling on the shoulder of the riporter
"What’s scarier is that he incited violence towards Taylor Swift after he survived, now MAGA might end up mass targeting little kids attending her concerts because the devil survived and ended up targeting innocent pure hearts."
Bro is losing votes so he staged a new one 🤣
"Well the title is right. ""FBIs latest Donald Trump assassination attempt"""
3rd time lucky?
"They are eating the dogs, they are eating the cats. They are eating the pets of the people that live there."
"Trump is the messiah of the jews 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂they love him to death, another religious nutter on a nutcase planet. WE'RE ALL CRAZY HERE -THE CHESIRE AILOUROS  (The usual ancient Greek word for ""cat"" was ailouros, meaning ""thing with the waving tail"", but this word could also be applied to any of the ""various long-tailed carnivores kept for catching mice"")😂😂"
Why they really are terrified that the Democrats wont get in again arent they
"I have noticed that these leftist media construct the title of the news of their rivals to raise doubt, and suspicion, whereas when it comes to their allies, they construct it to exaggerate the incident to make them more victimized to gain sympathy."
AK.... Why??? Interesting choice
Not so smart trump😂
"honestly its already mid september, trump should just relax at home and wait till november."
If this was in Africa they’d be shaming us day in day out. No one is safe in the US anymore.
"My approach is 
it's better just to think: okay this is the narrative they want people to believe, and then admit to myself there must be much more to it and I'll never know the real truth of any events reported in the mainstream news."
The deep state jews really want him gone to start ww3
Oh why is your citizens know the FBI is behind these plots to assassinate Trump. The Democratic Communist party sees him as a threat and they want to destroy our democracy. We also have the FBI which does the investigations and they covered up the first assassination attempts without revealing information about the gunman and their association with him. Now the second attempt and again the shooter was able like the first one to get close enough to the president to shoot at them. Of course the kindergarten secret service can't seem to protect anybody and we spend billions of dollars on this stupid agency to do the job that they can't seem to do twice. China and Russia and Iran in North Korea they all have hopes of getting rid of trump cuz he's the best defense that we have against these communist countries😂
More DISTRACTIONS 😅
"Trump - "" My golf shot is even more accurate than your AK 46"""
Many men-
Ohh really  ..is it real ?and he's still alive ??or just DRAMA?
Democrats have committed so many crimes they're willing to kill TRUMP to prevent him from taking office again!
this is for sure staged lol
Democrats better be ready for the energy they're about to get!
liberal left and so called voice of the free 😂😂😂 biggest scam same like taylor swift.
liberal left and so called voice of the free 😂😂😂 biggest scam same like taylor swift.
Why if you express your concerns regarding mass immigration the BBC call you “far right”. But if you try and assassinate someone you won’t label them “far left”? 🤔
No wayyy is this for real?
The very tolerant left 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Castro: I have 634 assassination attempts and died of natural causes.

Trump: Hold my 🍺."
Trump orcharsrated this to gain more votes
So basically Many Men part 2 should be out lol
""" Many men wish death upon me "" Donald Trump 😂"
So we see TDS on full display now and Trump has more assasination plots than JFK after his Bay of Pigs and who should we blame for Trumps once likable  persona turned into a Godzilla like creature aimed at tearing down the world with one scaley backswing. Kamala shouting Bloodbath in a pathetic Erkel voice?  I hope the misinformation police locks her up!
One can do anything for winning election...even attacks on ownself. shameful politics going on in USA
Democrats for sure
Long live President Trump but what did Trump do to Americans❤❤from Africa
"Why the quotation marks? Try investigating why the deep state dont want Trump to win again and will do anything to stop him.
Drain the Swamp!"
"Trump should quit, while he is still alive"
Rubbish. More Lies for Sympathy vote
"🤔👌When Trump exposes the biggest betrayal of the American people and says: We attacked the New York towers ourselves so that we can attack the Middle East, it becomes clear who wants to assassinate Trump."
Third time lucky???
"that's 2 for 2 what a white guy tried to off trump.

 don't you think it's high time for folks to investigate on white criminality?"
"that's 2 for 2 what a white guy tried to off trump.

 don't you think it's high time for folks to investigate on white criminality?"
Striking similarities between what they doing to Trump and what they did to Imran Khan
When you can’t win a debate so you roll out the local lunatic to make you look like a victim 😂
More propaganda
"Amazing how the photo of the gun is so grainy, like when aliens are filmed and photos taken they too are grainy. I think that the government does that to the quality of the image to hide facts."
Ong they was finna put him 6 feet down bruh like ion even wanna talk about this shi like thiss kniga catching strays daily like hol up aint no way they was tryna get my boy again like brooo oh my days😮
"'First time?'
'No, Second times'"
It's 2024 and the USA still thinks guns are great 🤦
"It will be another far right loser who believes trumps assasination will open the door for far right politics, same as the last one"
Someone should stop that right on right violence 😂
"Was Trump the actual target? Ummmm, lol?"
"America - the world sees your comments on videos like this. As an American who retired overseas, I thank my stars every day that I left you fools behind.  We all see how incredibly hateful and low IQ you have become over the last 2 generations.  We see America dying from here. Nobody on the planet is sad to see you go because you show us who you are every day. Just the lowest of the low. Even Russians are flummoxed by the depths America has fallen to, and look where they are these days.  ""Greatest country in the world?"" Yeah. Back in the 1950s, maybe. Ever since then, it went from a slow burning dumpster fire to what it is today, an uncivilized third world country. America has nothing on Venezuela."
"Im not a trump fan but trying to assassinate someone before the election is not democratic at all. Vote and accept the majority ruling, anything else is just rubbish. Nothing says ''i think my side can't win'' like trying to assassinate the other candidates. Being weak and cowardly hiding in the shadows is not the way to win, these attempts have pretty much handed the election to trump, especially with the ''fight'' fist pumps after getting shot at and injured. That shit was wild."
Ya’ll see the bug crawling on this guy lol
Too many theatrics 😂 let JD be president instead already
"JFK/RFK......
Let's fast forward 
TRUMP/RFK Jr. -same agendaaaa 
You figure it out"
Something is cooking as Donald Trump is clear cut winning..
"MORE LIES.... SS surveillance ""missed"" the shooter in Pennsylvania, on a WHITE rooftop, and shots were fired.... Today, the SS has the gall to state that an agent saw a DARK rifle barrel that was protruding INCHES through a chain link fence and it was supposedly ""noticed"" in time to prevent Trumps assassination?  YEA, when damn pigs fly....  AND, ""some bystander"", just happened to take a picture of the car's license tag which helped apprehend the perp?  MORE DAMN PIGS FLYING.... Today's FALSE FLAG event was staged to try to help the credibility of the SS, but, it only reinforced the theory that the government will do ANYTHING to further its mission to take out Trump....  Call me livid....

TRUMP 2024....  PERIOD...."
Look at the size of that BUG on the reporter ! That’s the real story here.
“Attempted Donald Trump assassination” in quotations as if it didn’t actually happen LOL
"He needs to stay home till after the election, he's obviously going to win, so stay home."
Hows the bug crawling over his shoulder lol
I highly doubt Trump will ever see the election night...
He is not gonna be able to play golf for a while … 😂
"Trump needs to leave all this and go enjoy his life. America is an absolute dump, let it rot away wokely."
Many men..
1st fo sure wasnt  scripted but the 2nd attempt seems sus now or a lot of people really wants him dead
FAR LEFT FASCIST VIOLENCE!
They really wanna start a civil war ...
The far left are proving to be the real problem of the world
"How bizarre, I was just thinking about the first attemp and out of nowhere this pops up on my feed... US is getting more and more out of control"
Amazing that the BBC can cover something that happens anywhere else in the world but when serious things happen in the UK THEY turn a bling eye....
He has time to play GOLF amidst a busy campaign!!!
How many lives does this man have
"The government always try assassinate the Presidents that are for the people, the more I listen to Trump the more I like him  he’s not a matrix President."
"reporter Tom Bateman is about to start dancing by the looks of him, he's on some good stuff out there, three ain't no flys on Tom, just super fly guy,"
Why are the top comments not pointing out the suspect voted for Trump and turned against him more recently and was supporting another GOP nominee when this happened? But it's the democrats fault somehow?
2:03 The bug appears on the right shoulder  - for those who only want to see the bug.
guy sounds like a robot ....get a new voice or fk off
"I’m happy bbc are reporting factual events with little to no opinions.
You might actually get back a few viewers."
That's the most satanic country in world.
I’m beginning to wonder if it’s staged. Funny how they always miss.
Only a matter of time before the left go to far left and start a civil war.
Let's just say the free world is being consumed by its own freedom.
Wonder what soft judgement the Welsh Wonder will get today?
So much for democracy
Someone promising to end funding to wars will by all means face this trump needs to be president again
"For a country full of guns ,they are not very good shots"
Again I don't buy this one either. We know Trump spent his whole presidency at the golf course . But how would this person know Trump would be there during the election period. Shouldn't he be busy trying to win ?? Or was this an effort to sway opinion since the first effort didnt work ....
This world is controlled by a elite network. They are so powerful trump know these peole by name and doesnt say a word. If that aint gansta i dontbknow what is.
No one will coment on the fly casually walking over the right shoulder on 2:01 ?
It will all fizzle out as a non event but it’s achieved its purpose of taking all the headlines away from Harris and back onto Trump. Funny that………
Dems really want this man gone they scared.
Is this just to distract from his cats and dogs statement and to keep him relevant 😂😂
"I feel like america is in deep sleep.
pro terrorists protests all over , the assassination attempts ...theres need to be a change and a very drastic one"
"""A lotta guys are saying I'm very immortal.  I'm not saying that.  The most immortal president they've ever seen they say.  I shot a hole in one today too, can you believe that.

They really do want to try and get theyre hands on Russias resources dont they.
They should investigate the Simpsons too............. They want to make their prediction true
"Dude, if you dont wanna vote for Trump then, don't vote for him.  But trying to kill a candidate just for Kamala to win is not so American way.  This is only politics, do not make it personal.  Do not kill your own dude...or better yet stay away from Politics if you cannot handle it...got it dude"
“And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere”
"So why no attempts on Kamalla Harris, not fair lol"
"He should stop the delay tactics of being sentenced for his federal convictions. His delusions of becoming president again so that he can pardon himself are just that, delusions."
Don’t vote for Donald Trump. His assassination attempts will never end. Eventually someone will succeed and his VP would become the president and no way would that person will be able to run the country. It’s better if we prevent all of that by not voting for Trump right now.
"They really are trying to cancel him , aren't they"
Far Left are real Terrorists
"Jesus christ come on how can this ol school tv dude get away with publicity stunts its like dont people remember the stuff people used to do b4 internet? They say its a cult but 4get what a cult means. 
Thrump (real name/gotta spell wrong cause yt erases my comments)  thrump attcacked citizens to hold that Bible upside down cause reporters was on tv saying he was hiding im the basement bunker something that they said abouy joe biden in a low key insult to people like me who wanted a nee 4th of july just from that. Than he did a insurrection with a guy mimicking the movie the patriot that was literally on netflix they mimicked it with the guy at the top of the stairs waving the thrump flag like ol glory. Than the ear. The Haitians than this. Come on this guy is really transparent. I also think he approved the vid being released. Its the one thing they never said he lied about even though when he tried to pun it on chi ha he put that pic of lady eating bat that turned out to be a stock photo of a philippian market place. Im sure he didn't close the schools allowed the antimaskers all over because of freedom not to spread it for the money they must have made in the market i bet mask companies was a stable cheep stock i also bet that these greedy types invested b4 the vid plan whent into effect and made top dollar after it skyrocketed  from the whole world needing masks 😷 im telling you guyz the trumpturds conspiracies was designed to make anything not told to you by officials is not true as if occams razor never existed. If i was someone who wanted to do smat i would go by a cheap laptop and a best buy drone go to the fireworks shop 4 ms and i would never have to leave my car or enter the parking lot of that private club he must-have been a member of.

This is really starting to sound flaky.

Tom Bateman's got weird-ass shaped glasses lol. What was he thinking?
suspected blackrock is not giving up lol
"Right wing supporters taking pot shots at their candidate yet not going after the Democrat nominee. After all the extreme conspiracies made up surrounding the Democrats, you would think that creates more motive. It sounds fishy."
He should step down... Too much going on!
Another confirmation that the United States is a gangster state that attempts on the lives of its own presidents
"Trump: how many assassination do you want?
Enemies: Yes...."
The FAR left strikes again.😂
"Major conspiracy!!! Don't be distracted by the smoke and mirrors!! Who is the person @0:19, and what is their connection to the story?????"
Trump is a real rapper now.
He wants hype
Florida should not let people own ak 47s
There is no valor in becoming a threat to democracy
Are they sure? It's Florida after all.
"Interesting that his most loyal cult members are white men, and yet the two assassination attempts were from white men.🤔"
Why everyone wants to kiss this old man😅😅😅
The picture I saw of the assassin's rifle looked more like an SKS than an AK-47.
"Also Donald Trump said ""I Love You"" in his statement, but I guess you left that out, probably because it may make him look to good!"
Trump is pivotal to the western  world this is why he must go. Wishing you well mr trump

Americans all those guns and no one can shoot straight.
"He really is popular, isn't he?"
"Sorry to say, I can't believe anything he says or his reality show drama anymore. I see a whole new line of NFT trading cards probably coming out. Even his own first post about it seems careful and breef. He just wants to drown out awards shows and real news.
He's desperate and bankrupting himself and everyone else. The only thing he's afraid of are the polls, even more lost votes and the many judges hammers about to come down."
Wow ... what a coincidence!!
"""Just get over it!"" What Trump said about the last school shooting!🤔⚖️🩵

Apparently it's reported that he was a disgruntled MAGA guy, no shortage there!"
Both 'attempts' are surely faked by his people
"Why do I feel like if Americans turn off their TV’s stuff will stop happening magically? 
This crazy matrix is just trying to infiltrate more chaos into society. 
This is ridiculous now"
Yeah right...
The BBC don’t seem to give a s***! Funny that!? Can you imagine if it was Harris!?
"Let me guess... they dont know of any motive?
He has as many assassination attempts as Kamala has interviews.
0-2"
But he says it's the illegals 😂 it's his own people born and raised here 🙄 😅
"Boring 🙄, Donald Trump was cheating at golf again at his own home lol, and gun shots were heard (apparently) on the grounds of his golf course (which has it's own security) and no one is certain if it was meant for him... Someone's been aprehended, but all seems a bit circumstancial.. Yawn.. guess he loved the attention from the first one."
Democrats are the real terrorists
Barely anyone reporting on it. They really want him dead
"How did the men who planned that he will shoot Trump knew where and what time he play golf? security saw the attacker this time and he is alive so he can give answers, the men vote for Trump 2016 but are against him know, violence is never the answer. In Usa they forget gunmen very quickly and continue like it never happened. There is always a risk when people can own guns and in wrong hands terrible murder happened and also innocent people die."

"Donald Trump can thank me later, but a safe place for him to be would probably be in prison."

Vote trump 2024 to save America from economic collapse

Why did you do it? Kamala is already winning
"Another staged ""attempt""? Shows how desperate the GOP are to win the sympathy vote."
"Can't understand when people say it is another miracle, it's mathematically more likely you miss a shot than get it right"
So many comments here show the true colors of leftists/democrats....
Practice is important. Young people these day are not even trying.
Wow …
really curious about the mindset of these people who really think they are doing the right thing by committing these acts
This won't be the last attempt because the swamp is deep and will do anything to win in the timespan given to them
The amount of people who don’t understand how easy it is for someone to get a gun and do this instead cry conspiracy when in actuality the ineptitude of the secret service just happened to coincide with someone who wanted him dead and failed. Considering the amount of mass shootings also done by those who aren’t exactly experts in firearms this shouldn’t be as surprising as it seems to be for some people.
"How pathetic is pit that Biden and Kamala ant win the election, and do this? Really"
"In the world of conspiracy theories, this could be done by the republicans to garner more sympathy for Trump.  Notice this time the shooter is a Democrat while the first shooter was a Republican.   Very weird."
"He won't survive on 3rd attempt ,what kind of crappy security they giving to trump"
"Usa -Defender of democracy😂😂
Not able to secure his opposition leader😂😂"
The most difficult thing is having to live among those who swallow media.
"The ""progressive left"" on full display again."
Again?🙄 How are they able to get so close to him? HIs security detail needs to be tightened.
"The FBI are onsite, ready to hose down the crime scene again."
"I do not believe  it was genuine . Two years unsuccessful 1:18  shots? Come on … Bear in mind who his friend is … 
Nah… it’s rather been set up"
Its really clear that trump is a threat for all american enemies😢
The first report said it was two guys going at each other and it was around the golf course. Come on media how yall spinning this story now 😂😂😂
"If I’m not seeing it, I’m not believing it especially with a man of this nature. Circumstantial at best"
Trump has seven more lives left. 🐈
Hi I am evynn I am so very worried about donald trump but I pray that he will be ok
"Good day, hope everyone is having a great blessed day, if you haven't already, be sure to Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour Romans 10:9-13, if you  believe in your heart and confess with your mouth, then you are saved. He's Coming Real Soon, Peace, Love, and God Bless..  Also John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son that whomever believes in Him, shall not perish but have everlasting life."
Democrats could never win fairly
The Democrats sure want him dead dont they.
I'm surprised there have only been 2 attempts in Trump's political history. Only 2... really?
"This is how big the stakes are. The opposition is downright evil. They stand to lose wars they cash in on, a whole global agenda, their efforts of mass indoctrination. I'm not saying Trump is great or the best of people but he really is the one standing between us and our loss of freedom. Pray for the man. Only God can protect him."
"All planned by him, he do anything to win"
3rd time lucky?
"Hollywood really loves to hype up their agencies like the CIA and FBI, but in reality...😆."
"Looked at the title from my phone with the words ""attempted"" and ""assassination"" on top of each other. At first glance the words blended together I genuinely thought it read ""Donald Trump assassinated"""
"Probably Trump will quit and the new nominee would be Huckerbee Sanders from Republican side and two women going at each other, will be interesting."
To be clear it most likely was not an ak-47 assault rifle. It was most likely an AK type civilian version of the rifle. You see in America you can own many various semi-automatic rifles with AR M4 or AK styles but you must have a special weapons license in order to get fully automatic weapons.
"This stinks more than a 🦨, T wants to win the elections at all costs, vote the victim, helped of course again by Mr Putin. Reports already of the suspect allegedly fought in Ukraine and was not happy with T, because Donald was against the help to Ukraine, it’s the most obvious Russian op ever, open your eyes!"
To be fair I think that's just how they play golf in Florida
"I don't think they like you, Don. lol"
"The main stream media needs to answer for this, falsely claiming that Trump was trying to overturn the election, when he was simply asking for a fair investigation which he did not get, “oh you don’t have everything that we asked for, that’s okay, Biden won despite what the American voters say”, that was the joke of the so called election investigation, that the mainstream media pushed to be true, they pushed that he was a threat to democracy and hired these nut hats to take him out!!! It’s already proven that the last assassin was hired, go look it up!! I already know that Commie Kamala will be president, I just hope that my preexisting conditions take me out before than!!!"
God bless that nothing happened to Donald Trump🙏🏻🙌🏻. That sucks even now we're still having to question everything these news outlets and social media let's out to the public. And okay the FBI and the CIA maybe helped save him this time. But this could be a easy setup from the FBI and the CIA to get trust back with Donald Trump and American citizens. I do not trust the FBI and the CIA social media and news outlets💯. Once again God bless you Donald Trump🙏🏻🙌🏻
He said he was safe and well just before he sent out the begging email.  🤔
I wouldn't even call that anymore since It only took one attempted assassination to kill JFK. Now it's just the reality we live in.
"2 thoughts came to my mind. 1. For people he seems to be a disposable target practice/people understand what will become of USA and want to take matters in their own hands. 2. Knowing how Trump is this could easily be a stunt to get the focus back to him being a ""hero"", a feeble attempt to win votes. Both sound really sad and scary. 😞"
Fake bs lol
Maybe his supporters don’t really like him
Maybe his supports don’t really like him
"This man needs to be wearing a Viking hat with his bullet proof vest, but it's not very stylish.
And NOBODY remembers there was a BOMBING of a building in NASHVILLE that HOUSED  the LAW FIRM that was SUING ""DOMINION?"" Right ? No reasonS to concentrate on ANYTHING that happened in 2020, Right ?  Where are those ""proposed perpetrators"" TODAY? Living in a brand new MOBILE HOME ?"
AK47 -> Russia -> Warning from Putin to perform better in his campaign?
"Stop hiring amateurs, Melania! LOL 😂"
"Don't be at all surprised if the same despicable Democrat party who sanctioned a national transgender day of vision on the very same day as Christ rose from the dead on Easter, won't be content until they have Trump in the ground.  These people have proven beyond any benefit of a doubt that they are desperately evil. To believe that multiple attempts on Trump's life is purely coincidental would be insane. If you thought trust was a rare commodity before. welcome to a planet where it doesn't exist any more."
"I'm suspicious about these ""attempted assassinations"".  I am sure his security is way up after the Butler, PA incident.  So, just how did another ""would-be assassin"" slide through???  Hmmm.    Interesting that Trump posted his ""safe and well"" comment on a fundraising email, like anyone would, of course.  To the effect of: ""I just had an assassination attempt.  I will let everyone know.... in my fundraiser letter""...  Umm, yeah.  Coincidentally, these attempts have a positive effect for Trump, like a gift, at a time he is sinking in support and the polls, after his dog-eating debate produced a dismal performance.  He has desperately needed a positive upshot.  And here one just drops out of the sky, poofedy-do, like that.  Just very coincidental and it smells funny."
The government investigating itself lol
It’s real war
Donald Trump is in complete psychiatric collapse
"Mr Trump must has a special "" secret service "" like in my country Indonesia few years ago , he work as a "" ghost "" ,   since he was in duties look after former Indonesia president never failed !!! He worked as a ghost excellent duties for our former Indonesia president !!! 😎👍🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩"
"AHMM..IF TRUMP BECOMES U.S. PRES, AND EVENTUALLY ASSASSINATED, LUCKY FOR HIS VICE PRESIDENT, HE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY THE U.S. PRESIDENT, VERY LUCKY, THE V.P."
Hopefully not a stant to win sympathy votes. Anything/everything is possible in politics.😂
There IS a higher power. Strike 1 was meant for him to change. He didn’t so now a second warning (strike 2). Strike 3 he’s out. Higher power keeps sparing his life maybe because we need him?? Ah I’m just thinkin outside the box
bro is literally the main character
"😂 Watch out for Trump, Donald Trump, agent 666, in the latest news instalment of: ""You Only Miss Twice!"" 🎼🎵🎶"
"The Secret Service, after the first attempt was questioned and got a light slap on the wrist. no, this is absolutely unheard of in our history of a second attempt. many people need to lose their jobs."
He’s pushing this agenda too much. It’s gonna backfire.
"Just more publicity for Trump. Always seems to be perfect timing for these ""attempts""
And as others have asked...How did the guy know Trump was playing golf there?"
The democrats reaply dont want this guy winning 😂 they openly just sending assassins
All ive learned Americans are really shitty shots
JFK must be ready pissed off that trump always gets the storm troopers for assassins
Its like someone firing off shots in a neighbourhood to lower rent prices but Trump want to increase his polling numbers lol
"Another day, another far right propaganda. 😂"
The bug on the reporter right shoulder is bigger than Trump assassination attempt
So appalling.  I'm glad President Trump and others are ok 🙏 Moms for Trump/Vance 🇺🇸 MAGA 🙏
"The leftists want to eliminate Donald Trump at any cost, and the important media will only announce it when he is dead, they are very hypocritical people, that's why I will vote for Donald Trump  , DONALD PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATE"
"Tin foil hat moment but after the first attempt he had a bump in the polls, feels like an attemp to see that happy again... Honestly horrible that people don't trust fair and free elections enough to see him not get a second term based on Nov results"
"The reporter's bug is actually the latest CIA/FBI spyware. There x000's of'em within 5km of the former president, collecting data on everything about everyone!"
The only interesting thing about this Breaking News is that bug on the reporters shoulder where’s the security come on guys 😩😫
They're really scared of Trump. I'm curious why!
Imagine this if this is only show to make his name popular. Very scary to make everything to win
Bro if your the most fired upon president in history maybe that should tell you something 😆 🤣 your not mentally stable and shouldnt be in office drop the race like biden did
Deep state is too powerful 😂😂
Yes they want him out thanks to Kamala and inciting violence against Trump
"He was ""between holes"". What were the girls names? Lol"
Guys this is already preditced the higher ups want him gone
"Trump, rhe consumate reality TV guy and con-man has found another eay to put himself in fhe headlines, again.
The last time around, it only bought him a week then the World moved on from him.
That campaign is becoming desperate.
Tonorrow, he'll be on telling us how bigly brave he is."
First to survive 2 attempts since Gerald Ford
"Damn, Melania’s really pissed now"
Praying for President Trump for God to keep him safe.
"USA slowly 🐌  falling apart , I away the declassified documents  to be released on the  assassination attempts on Trumps life & with the way things are going I'm sure if it gets released it will be after ww3 😮"
Check out The Project 2025 Song by Kravits it is brilliant!  Vote Harris/Walz 2024
Worse kind of campaign propaganda
Sure Ukraine linked to this
All nonsense. Fabricated bulls*** to drum up support for him (who is otherwise a completely unsympathetic character). Probably paid for it all himself.
No other president had TWO attempts.
They really don’t want this man to be president. Do they?
They really don’t want this man to be president. Do they?
"He orchestrated it, He is desperate to win the election."
"I'm not buying this. i mean it's Florida, everyone has an AR and a scope of some kind"
I think its bullshit ... i think he set it up...like the last one....trump just wants attention.....
"""Before me, nobody even knew that a single President could be the target for this many assassination attempts... Believe me!"""
"John 14:6 Jesus said to him,  ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.
1 Corinthians 15:3 that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. 
Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.   ❤"
Nobody wants Trump. Send him to prison.
Got a good excuse to leave race. Loser.
Wow
Third time lucky then maybe?  🙄
Wonder if this is FBI set up just to repair their damaged rep from the first attempt? Very convenient how mr FBI spotted the gun in the bushes but not a kid with a gun up a roof after people can point at him clearly.
More trumpanzee horseshit
Um... a civillian grade ak-47 is not an assault rifle goofy
Another fake assassination by maga trump trash media to try and boost him for re-election cause he got destroyed at the debate. He'll do anything to try and win over brain dead morons and pull as much propaganda bs as he can to win a legit election😂
Man makes his own bed reap what you soe.
Step right up you loonies.....third time's the charm.
"The prime suspect is actually a Trump supporting Republican, albeit, a very mentally unstable one at that. These days, ""mentally unstable' and 'Republican"" are words that are pretty synonymous with each other."
Okay. So a nutjob got within a quarter mile of this clowns golf club. Why is this all over the news????
"Every time the popularity of trump starts decreasing, they launch this kind of a very old movie."
"Ukraine is becoming desperate, lol"
"Off topic, but I wonder how many tried to assassinate Hitler when he was alive"
I think afew attempts were made on Obama. But no one got this close. But Trump's actions are more erratic so that might cause some challenges
Again? How can there be so many incompetent shooters out there? Seems sus.
LOL   what an idiot   trump wants everyone to feel sorry for him   awww  the poor dictator whose sons shoot leopards... awww
"“I really don’t care, do U?”"
Things have really fallen apart since he was elected in 2016.
He must of mistaken trump for the neighbours dog lol
They really want a president who is pro war
He’s the Jussie Smollet of presidents lol
Trump Security personnel are trying their best not to do their jobs.
And that's the people supporting camala......
Got more lives than hitler
"On January 6th, 2021, Trump and his allies engaged in a violent coup attempt to overthrow American democracy. Trump and his allies belong in prison for life (and all of their assets need to be seized). On July 13th and September 15th, 2024, Trump almost reaped what he has been sowing for years (with both ""attempts"" committed by Republicans)...and Trump certainly doesn't care if some of his own supporters get hurt. Trump admitted that he intends to destroy American democracy and become a permanent dictator; on July 26, 2024 Trump stated: ""You won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore."""

"Not until Trump is assassinated thats when you will see how serious this is, all you anttrump it won't do you good, its time America stood together and have a safe, Free and open election, Am a Tanzanian who love your beautiful country so much, this has nothing to do with democrats or republican, when news like this pops out it is reducing you CV of America being the greatest Democracy, shame on you all supporting this biberic acts😢 shame!!!"
"More this is happening more I feel JFK was assassinated by Democrats, CIA, Corporate Media and Neocons."
After his lies at the debate there are Haitian people being harassed and having bomb threats made against them and their families. If this was real there is a certain amount of karma involved (not to be mistaken for Kamala).
"Here in US, nothing said. Harris bias media will get around to it after football games. Ok, 😂, American throwing ball by hand around games and actually kicking it by foot for..... field gooaaalllll."

"Fight! Fight! Fight! The man has a set (if you know what I mean) most people would never leave their house again. Trump is as tough as nails & he was a great president and Will be again. I pray these devils 👤stop trying to hurt him. Ya know it says a lot that they are trying to k!ll him, really think about it! They are afraid of him because they can't control him, he's not a puppet and he loves his country (OUR COUNTRY) God bless America & God bless Donald Trump! 
❤ Trump 2024)"
"This story is dejavu, of same sequel different story, like 9/11 to attack Iraq, but now to attack Iran. Hmmm good luck lossers."
He sure is getting popular lately isn't he
Trump preaches this kind of behaviour!
I pray Donald Trump uses some of his own money to protect his life because it’s clear our government would rather fund proxy wars than protect our leading Presidential candidate.
I love how this story was buried and just stumbled upon it as I was scrolling!!!!!!! I won’t say what I’m thinking because it’s obvious……!
1:58 top right should - Hello moth
Mr. Van Gogh is very lucky.
He sure is going after the pity vote
Is no one going to talk about the huge cockroach on his shoulder?
Oh please...another planned attempt...to gain votes lol he knows he's gonna lose
He lost against kamala so this his way of getting back on top via peoples pity
They need investigate him first
I dont even like trump but ive never wanted someone to be president more 😂😂😂 last days of Rome yooooooo
Surprised the  BBC isn't blaming it on trump...
Someone really wants J.D.Vance as president 🙄
"OMG, Trump's first response afterwards is to grift for more donations!?!?!

What a con job!"
"Lol, AMERICANS.....wait for NETFLIX SPECIAL, i bet he is behind all of this."
Trump will always play golf 😂😂😂😂whoever wanna play you have to be very clear 😂
😂it never happened on property nor even close to Trump even as close from a rooftop like the kid . Also Springfield Residents under threat by Trump's Minions is more alarming
Anyone else see that bug on the reporters shoulder? Dude was photobombing lol

FBI AND THE DEMONCRATS HAVE GOT TO QUIT TRYING TO KILL THE OPPOSITION!! THIS IS NOT HOW A REPUBLIC WORKS!!!! DEMOCRATS HAVE GOT TO BE THE MOST ANTI GOD ESTABLISMENT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! RIDICULOUS
An AK isn't an Assault Rifle. I'm pretty sure other news media has stated that it was a Semi-automatic rifle.
"More looney leftists, surprise surprise."
"To address Democrats who might be skeptical, it's important to emphasize that Donald Trump’s assassination was not staged because the security and intelligence agencies responsible for his protection have rigorous protocols and checks in place. Any genuine threat to a high-profile individual like a former president would be thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the complexity of orchestrating and covering up such an event without credible evidence or leaks is highly improbable. The lack of substantial, verifiable evidence supporting the idea of a staged assassination reinforces that this notion is more likely a conspiracy theory rather than a reflection of actual events.The lack of substantial, verifiable evidence supporting the idea of a staged assassination reinforces that this notion is more likely a conspiracy theory rather than a reflection of actual events."
"Who could it be, we wonder?  Who could it possibly be, that was the target of an automatic weapon fired at a golf course while DJT played golf?

"I'm sorry but I'm from a country where politicians have used 'assassination attempts' to use sympathy votes and come into power.. I don't want to cook up conspiracy theories here. I just want to say that people should vote based on their policies and what they stand for, whether the candidate is suitable to be the President of the most powerful country in the world, not based on sympathy."
It is exactly Trump who strongly opposes gun control.
"that's BS, twice and still standing !
He wants so much attention..."
The other side fears trump will end their new world order
They don't want America become Great again. 👍🏻
FBI latest attempt is literally the headline 😂
"They said Donald trump was between two holes, hmmm very well putt🤔"
Lol even hi own followers are trying to take him our 🤣 that says something dor the creep
"so to get it straight.
Trump a president who wants to get rid of illegals and make his country safe for americans = attempted assaination twice.
Kamala a person who said she will welcome anyone of any background with open arms america is their home = can walk around where ever she wants without any secruity and no one will even look at her wrong.

Almost like their is a pattern that matches the gaslighting media that are trying to brainwash people into thinking illegals are to be worshiped even though most of them are confirmed criminals and anyone who raises their voice against letting them in is a free target. Crazy. This is just hard evidence that media need to be held acountable and be put in prison. You are the people who breed this behaviour you are the people who breed killers because they think these illegal criminals must be protected at all costs."
Dereliction of duty Donnie is responsible for tens of thousands of Americans dead. He withheld transmission evidence of the pandemic for months and robbed us of time to prepare. He then said it was a Democratic hoax. He then said it would go away quickly. We wish he would go away quickly to prison forever.
The man iscompletely unhinged. He was upset because Biden/Harries didn’t visit the people that got hurt in the last assassination attempt on Trump.  Nor did they go to the funeral of the man who was murdered that day. He is upset that that the world isn’t doing enough for the Ukraine. He tries to kill the one President that kept Russia at bay the same President that will end the war in Ukraine. The one President that didn’t start any new wars and had a peace deal in the Middle East. The irony in his cause!
Trump god is with you.. keep rocking ..we need you to stop all idolatry that other country people bring inside the gods own nation
"This is the second trumper or former trumper who has tried this. Republicans realize he is killing the party and are trying to save it. Some people would say this is reasonable, some would say it is not reasonable."
"""Donald Trump Claims""  ... a for of phrase the BBC would NEVER say about the proven - easily proven - lies by the Harris administration.

The same turn of phrase the far left activist  BBC would never prepend before wild claims by Hamas or Zelenski, but ALWAYS use to ""cast doubt of"" the BBC's ideological pariahs.

FFS --- why not employ actual journalists tasked with reporting the news instead of parroting the far left ""progressive"" talking points ?

The BBC who lied for months about Trump being a ""Russian Asset"" because 50 liars in the FBI (all Democrats) said so?
Sheesh, I don't even like Trump, but at least e knows what day it is, what town he;s in, what accent he speaks with and what race he was born to."
Long Live the 2nd Amendment !!!
"LOL What the hell have you become, America?"
Apparently
Great PR stunt
Wow again. gotta be safe
"My dear Trump, you and me and all of us faithful have been saved by our Lord Jesus Christ who died on the Holy Cross,and then was raised to the heaven to live and reign in glory with our eternal Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit. God forever. Amen
Our Lord dashes away Himself each of our enemy and each of threat invading on us faithful.
It is the basic route,root and foundation of our faith and we must believe in it if we love and follow the way to the Holy Cross. Mister Trump is the believer of unity and sovereignty of the people of USA. 
God bless USA. 🇺🇲➕🌏🙏👪👨‍❤️‍👨🔥"
"With Biden saying Don't eat cats and dogs. Trump needs  one for this like... ""You're not trying hard enough."" Or ""You need to do better than that to get rid of ol Donald."" Or ""My third leg has a better aim than your gun.""."
The far left is by far the biggest threat to democracy in America!
Wow it seems like white people frequently resort to violence in expressing their political dissatisfaction.😳😳😳
"When this was first reported it was said 2 men were shooting outside of and near Trumps golf course, what happened to that report?  Leave it to Trump to capitalize yet again on a situation and try to turn it into something that brings attention to him."
Just to add perverts working for the BBC is the new norm. Allegedly just saying.
"2:18 Sir, remain calm and don't look on your shoulder"
THE ELITES THE MEDIA THE DEMOCRATS & THE GOVERNMENT ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN AGAINST TRUMP SO THEY CAN ELECT KAMALA HARRIS AS THERE PUPPET TO KEEP THE WARS GOING AND TO KEEP THE POOR POORER!!!!

"The traitors that opened our borders for the illegals have the main aim of eliminating Trump. The globalists, Communists together with the Jihadist backed by China and rich traitors of this country would go to any extend to destroy this great nation. They conveniently made Sanctuary Cities to harbor breed and protect terrorists to achieve their vicious goal! Which nation on this planet will open its borders to the enemies throwing its innocent citizens into the hands of these criminals? America lost its sober mind !"
FBI involved? Probably one of their own.
Are we sure trump isn’t planning these things so people will vote for him? Wouldn’t put it past him. We all know he’s about show business.
"It's very strange how this happened right of he lost the debate with Kamala????😳....the last time he was behind in the polls, then all of a sudden someone tried to ""assassinate"" him. Interesting! ..smh"
"👁️This was staged so they could get your attention away from the fact that CIA plotted to kill Venezuelan president Nicholas muduro, why CNN or other huge news outlets pushing news about that?
The thruth will be revealed in the next 24 hrs."
"Is it just me or does anyone else think the level of security is suspect, how fk does anyone with a rifle get anywhere near a leading candidate for the president."
There really is a spotted lantern fly invasion eh
Baffled that the GOP still won't admit that there are too many F***ing guns
Is this really news? 😅
How many times are these people gonna try and kill this man? Don’t they  know if you have to cheat to win you’re a loser.
Just watched bbc news. How come 2 shootings out of thousands every week is now the new norm for election hopefuls? This is not factual  and doesn't do much for uk/ usa relations. You are more anti trump than you are anti tory! Laugh my nuts off if Trump gets in and reform party take many seats in local elections in May.
Assume it's staged rather than assume it's genuine.
Same trick won’t work as well as the first time
"Now I'm not usually sceptical but in this situation I would have to say ""what a load of bollocks""…"
Kinda sus this happened after he lost a debate lol
"This, as a UK citizen, ought to tell you all you need to know. They want him dead. Why..? Because he believes in his country, protecting his country and the Americans of his country… if this man is unalived, like Diana was, it’s because they want him to be shut down like Diana was. Different people, different agendas, facing the same adversities. Stop voting for pathetic showpieces. Vote for what’s right for you, your families, your nation and your world. We don’t need word salad in charge of bombs, weapons and wars. We need people who care about their fellow citizens. I REALLY hope that he lives to win your election because the absolute chaos and atrocities that will ensue after your previous encumbrances… please stop this pattern of hatred for your own fellow people. It has to stop now. It has to stop with your vote. If Kamel gets in… I feel sorry for the entire world… she’ll try to giggle her way out of being responsible for a nation."
"Trump was worse for the economy.
Yes, Covid caused inflation first wide, but inflation was initially triggered by trumps tariffs on imports.
Then, while thousands died in Europe everyday and US was still not impacted by Covid, he didn’t take any precaution, which caused Covid to sweep across the whole country.
Now inflation was brought down under Biden administration, WITHOUT a recession, and that is pretty remarkable.
And rate of inflation going down is best experienced by US than any other country. You’d have to go to mars to have a cheaper standard of living than the US at this point.
Biden infrastructure bills, medicine price bill, and inflation bill is doing wonders for this country, meanwhile trump is talking about making deals with ‘tech bros’ while giving no crap about the middle class."
"Trumps enemies turned out not to be peaceful an ar ch is ts  defending your civil liberties from the ri ght... the an ar ch is ts have  just been sitting it out on a couch the last 5 years, hands off, watching Trump and his mouth sink himself and taking the GOP with him...     but...  rather, his motivated enemies are... his own gwn nwt supporters."
"Did you hear from Trump, himself?   Is he truly well, safe?  Do not trust outlets, want to see Trump."
The establishment really doesn't want trump in office..all the more reason to vote him in.
The US is like a crime filled country or some sort of civil war is starting.
"It's was just Jared role playing the old movie ""The park is mine""...."
"Oh good, the FBI is investigating..😂"
Trump will win
AK-47 'assault' rifle?  You know the journalist is full of s*it when they use a term that is used is a BS manner.  Define which rifles are 'assault' and which are not.  Liberal garbage
The guy is a trump supporter trying to drum up drama and more sympathy
Is it just me that see’s the huge bug on the left side of this news reporters shoulder it’s literally taking a stroll around him 🐜2:04
"If you're so confident Kamala is the greatest candidate since Jesus, why are you so desperate to eliminate the competition???"
We must unite the country says the Democrats lol
Almost like it's too easy to get a gun there......
"Not as well choreographed as the first attempt, (that gave him the convention boost) but a failed attempt at the golf course isn’t going  to  cut it. Even MAGA knows they can’t afford to lose even one more supporter. Just think. Corey Comperator died and was buried and forgotten for this!  And Trump is still going to lose after all.  51 Days."
Will the News media ever get it right? Do your research people. Its not called an Assault Rifle...🙄
"The only takeaway is that there needs to be stricter gun control in the US. Also, good work Secret Service!"
CNN: mostly peaceful assassination
I’m not surprised lol he was just telling him he needed to go to work
The mainstream media is responsible.
arent we going to talk about how the reporter did a phenomenal job of reporting without flinching despite the bug crawling on him?
"Well Trump wants to put fear in people. I see no reason why he can't live in fear either. all are fair game in nature, Trump is no different or better than any other human."
Its ok theyre where in the lgbtq community. Makes it okay in this day and age i think😂
"Very suspicious! Trump almost shot by Patrick Bateman, and then his brother, Tom, just so happened to be nearby to report on it!"
"If the former president of the world's strongest economy isn't safe in his own country, it raises serious concerns."
I hope this chaos ends already. Trump has been pure chaos. He needs to lose again so we can get back to some kind of normal.
He really shouldn’t be running for office.
"he really wants to win the election, he already ''killed 1 guy'' (probably living under a fake ID in alaska wih a couple of millions in his bank) , lets see where this 1 is at."
With us now is my special guest Mr Roach would just like to say a few words.
Is USA a democracy really ?!
"I don't like the guy, but I find just terrifying what might happen in the country if such an attempt is successful. In some channels they claim they'd start a nation-wide uprising, and funnily enough, a Trump supporter even said it would be good if such thing happened because of what it would provoke..."
I hope they plan to keep trump out of general population when he goes to prison. Lol
"""He was between holes""
Are we sure the man was playing golf. Could have just been getting freaky on his lawn."
The deep state is really nervous about Trump's victory.    I wonder why🤔?
Didnt get the attention he wanted the first time around so why not try faking it another time😂 this whole election is just a comedy movie at this point. I'd be so embarrassed if i was an American right now😂
The media has clearly caused all of this. Shame on you
Not me watching the video twice because I missed the bug the first time around.
"Clearly these assassins have never heard ""practice makes perfect""! 🙄"
Swifties are that loyal
What a load of BS lol
Deepstate really don't him to win the election 😂
lol
I thought they were going with more prosecutions and more media hit pieces not additional assignation attempts. I think you the good guys need to pick a strategy and stick to it.
BS!  This is a paid distraction from the humiliating debate Trump is suffering most from.  No attempted elimination happened besides the attempted elimination of the truth!
"More than likely just a made up conspired trump bullshit fake news story to try to get more votes as the last attempt on his life got him more people that felt sorry for him and will cast there vote for him as a compassionate vote and now that Kamalah Harris is in to get the top job (and i hope she does).
Im still bewildered that people still voted for him in the first time he was made president. 
Its funny that he didnt go around saying that the election he won was all rigged and biased towards Hillary Clinton pfffttt ,, hahaha.
I mean with the huge amount of guns they have got in America it wouldnt matter where you were you would go you would hear a gun shot but i think in this case its more than likely just fake news from frump bandwagon hahaha."
I heard Donald trump was strong....
What will keep us safe from trump 🤔. He’s a narcissist ! Great Americans won’t vote trump
CIA lol
"This is going to be a trending act, right?"
Bro is the main character 💀
Someone hates low interest rates affordable housing food they can afford or jobs staying home rather than going abroad or the sane thought like men and woman are different not the same gender. You know logical thinking
"Oh no!

Anyway, as an American, the biggest news today is still that I had a meatball sub with the cheese melted to the bread underneath the meatballs. I think it's the superior way to make one!"
"I’m Canadian so my gun knowledge is limited, I am not surprised as to the huge commentary on the accuracy of an AK47 or lack there of as I suspect UK military veterans as well as the average American are making the comments."
"Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe is speaking now on CNN.

He speculates that the suspect’s positioning on the golf course, “Would indicate that he knew the layout of the course,” and that it seems to show a “high degree of planning”, but that the question is how the suspect knew that Trump would be playing today.

He said that it may have just been luck."
why more and more terrorists in the Us?
"2:06 The way the bug roamed free on his suit and disappeared, still hunting me"
Im sure it wasn't some kind of set-up! paid actor etc! who knew Trump's golf appointment
"i thought he was arrested...oh right, he has money..."
"Clear Iran , far left , and others want trump dead. Just makes it more apparent who is the right person to be president of the US. Trump 2024."
I thought Sara Jane Moore was still in New York.
"Trump's new walk out song should be ""I'm still standing"" by Elton John."
Trump desperately wants to win now. Being president again is the only way he doesn't die in a prison cell.
Really..something don't sound right
"Between holes he says, lol"
"Hmm man get completely buggered in the debate, cries about, says he won't do another and magically there's another attempt. 

Bro no one wants you dead it too funny seeing you chat bollocks about eating dogs."
Ah ah ah ah Staying Alive Staying Alive….ah ahahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh Stayinggggggggggggg Aliveeeeeessssss
I’m sure the woke lefties will sweep this under the rug like the first attempt on his life and cry victim and rage about the extreme right
"Trump's ear looks like it never got injured.
Which is odd as it should have been really messed up."
white folks at it again.. but trumps says mexicans are the problem close the border lmao
"Guns in America 😂😂😂😂
Trillions and trillions business
For America 😂😂😂
Why stop the guns
Same old record"
I guess this is another first for any president! Two attempts! WTH!
Bit odd now this looks like they really don't want him back in.very fishy
I dont buy this PR balony this latest hoax is just so he can deflect from the 'I H8 T.S' outburst 😂😂😂
"I’m not saying it’s staged, but even if it was, would anyone even be surprised anymore?"
Every time Trump is in danger he becomes more popular.
Insect on the journalist's shoulder is pretty huge
"My bet is a set up by Trump, hoping for the good publicity he got last time....."
2:00 There's a lanternfly or something saying hello on his right shoulder.
"Trump dodging bullets, kamala dodging questions lol"
"He’s such a kind, intelligent, honest, compassionate person, I’m shocked,"
Go fund me so someone gets it right?
So we just gonna pretend that there wasn’t a bug on his shoulder lol
Cheap politicians
Dude completely ignored that big ass bug
Wow the biden administration are really trying to stop him.
"Imagine  your own red hats and faux entertainment calling out the B. S.  Lies from Donald. &   republicans from office now voting For Harris.
 Solitary  red shooter mentally unstable young white male."""
"That bug came up at the right time and was like, they did what to Trump. Then waved talking bout hi mom😂"
They really don’t like this guy
"Trying the sympathy vote again is he because Kamala is kicking his old ass? 😂 

Keep going guys. Third time lucky 🤞"
"This is actually sad though, even though I don't really agree with a good amount of his politics, this is still upsetting."
some bug is crawling on his jacket :)) 2:04
Why does this not suprise me.  Narcissists dont change. Narcissists should never end up in power. They are incredibly toxic and damage those around them and far more if they have power.
I thought Americans were good shots?  Apparently not.
The NRA must be so proud
Imagine being a big bloated loud orange as big as the koolaid man and y’all can’t hit him who taught y’all bums how to aim
Was that a lantern fly crawling on the reporter's right (viewer's left) shoulder?
The devil looks after his own...
"The USA is a strange country, almost everyone was in the army, there are twice as many weapons as people - and as you can see - no one can shoot properly 😂😂😂"
Democrats trying their best again
Like Elon said the Matrix will fight back!  the gov doesn't want Trump to win because he want to clean up the gov with Elon make it more efficient
"Many men
Wish death upon me"
"Really? Only two attempts? If more people read project 2025, I’m surprised that there isn’t a mob claiming his head right now."
FFS you only have to be lucky once 😂😂😂😂
I think it's fair to say that certain people need to SEVERELY calm down their violent rhetoric against him which causes these types of incidents...
The establishment is terrified of him getting into Office again. They don't want any delays for their New World Order.
Could well be one of the country members of a certain country that are trying to take over Palestine  🤔
Once again another Trump supporter trying to shoot at old boy..
"Good ol' 'Teflon Don'
Doesn't surprise me"
"Is it another “lone wolf”?
Yeah ok. 
Smells like deep state to me."
"If Trump wins, he's going to be living in a bulletproof aquarium for four years."
Donald trump won’t be at peace even after he wins the elections
"Nah, i think donald is setting this up so that he could get sympathy and votes.. Well good luck for the guy and stay safe"
Don't trust the FBI. Thank god you are safe our President. Knew they would try again.
Third time lucky
"ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO DEFEND OURSELVES. 

NOTHING ELSE. 
THEY ARE STOPPING AT NOTHING TO DISARM AMERICA. 

😂😅😆
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT."
"Got to love   the secret service,  you can walk into bushes  with a rifle overlooking the golf coarse. and don't forget and out of them with no law enforcement seeing him do i have this correct? i wonder who is going to be promoted . you know Trump can decline secret service protection, might want to pay for his own."
"""Many men,.... many, many, many men, .... wish death on me"""
"It's his own followers. The ones who have finally realised he lied, duped, and conned them. That he's mentally unwell... and, well, they have the guns and the intent. So, they keep trying. He made this bed himself. I only hope the FBI, CIA and SService can keep him safe."
don’t sound so pleased you bbc ****
Is this just Donald's attempt of seeking attention? So cheap
"You know, when they said Trump would end up as America's most wanted, I never thought it'd be from the other side of the law."
The Democrats habitually claim that the uneducated Republican yokels are conspiracy theorists. Seems they're now very quick to jump on the conspiratorial bandwagon now. How many of them have claimed that bot assassination attempts were set up by Trump's affiliates? 😄😄
"This is hella suspicious. Like if you have an AK how do you miss all the shots on an open field like a golf course, and then ESCAPE. Leading from the last guy you should know that such a high profile assasination is a suicide mission, so surely you would stick around to ensure the job is done if you had that much hatred. Given the rarity of such assasinations and the short time period (which would mean extra hightened security) I doubt the chances that this could have occured without some inside manipulation of some form."
"BBC reporting this in America but nothing in the UK what is happening on our own streets, what a surprise."
The FBI is also a.suspect and very complicit in both attempts.
At some point it will be just his supporters doing it to make it seen like he's invincible and more Messiah-like.
2:02 I guess cicadas are also interested in recent news updates
More inside bullshit.  Trump is part of this orchestrated nonsense
"Staged. Drumpf wants sympathy to get a lead in polls. Paid person to ""shoot nearby"" to spin the story as an assassination attempt for polictal gain"
Its hard for them to be against this when they love guns the most
"Cowards, cowards, cowards and more cowards"
"Reading the comments here, I might suggest this line of defense for the defendant: ""I'm really a Trump supporter and did it to boost his polls!""
Wonder if the judiciary will fall for it?
"
But the Democrats are the 'Nice' side? 🤣🤣
I thought Mericá loved him?😂😂😂
Being assassinated by his own people 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Americans  🫠
Trump is winning in a landslide. Thats why they’re doing this to him. If the debate had gone well for Harris they would leave Trump alone but because he won the debate they’re back to plan B.
AK with a scope? Funny.
Unbelievable is too honest a comment on this
"Considering the USA has the right to bear arms, the most guns per person, the most guns, the most school shootings and couldn't win gold at the Olympics despite their national pool of competitors with experience... I think anyone that is older than 16 shouldn't attempt to assinate trump again. Because it seems anyone that is capable of being a good shot in the USA is locked up for life 😂"
Guys the prank wasnt funny the first time. It ain't gonna be funny a 2nd time
Wouldn't be surprised if Trump hired them to get more publicity.
"3rd time ""lucky"", perhaps.....?"
"The news agency’s slander has led to multiple attempts on a man’s life…
This is very egregious & should be vindicated with lawsuits"
More American bull 😂
3rd. time lucky?
"Jesus Christ, after all he is a human being like everyone else with family and right to enjoy the life peacefully. This world is becoming an absolute joke 😢"
that giant moth on the reporters shoulder lol
3rd time lucky i guess
"This time I'm at least a little suspicious. He's so desperate to take attention away from his ‘I'm so great, that was my greatest debate ever’ 🙄. If this was an assassination attempt why was all that happened that they heard gun shots?"
"Maybe he's trying to get back on top, by ""getting shot at""?"
"The left dont give up trying to kill DJT, the lizard cult at its best"
"When you get woke far left news channels in america, This is what happens, They all say lets shoot trump, Just leave the poor man alone to win 2024 in peace please "
Am I the only one seeing the bug on his right shoulder at the end of the video
They really want him to win
Ohh dear...they are really trying to make America great!!
Everyone knows if you want to find comrade trump go to the nearest golf course and look for an extremely old orange dude cheating at golf
The party of love seems to be full of hate 🤔
The party of love seems to be full of hate 🤔
"Staged MAGA will believe it! haha, comedy gold, getting desperate! <3"
"Chinese cheep copy AK47 of the famous Калашникова rifle, effect range 300M. Was it used effectively ? Or did the cheap plastic vertical grip break along with the scope mount bought from TEMU ?"
I don't like Trump but I would vote him in so Kamala Harris never gets the top job. If you all think Biden was bad then wait for this one to get into office. America is finished if that happens. Another attempt on this man shows me who does not live in America that they're running scared. Why do they fear him so much ? His first term he is the only President in my own life that actually did what he said he would do. He delivered on his campaign promises. Had he still been in office what we all have had to go through these past four years would never have happened. I would vote TRUMP in as Prime Minister in this country never mind America and again I don't like him as a man but as a man of the people he got it right.
Its such BS ..NEVER EVER has there been so much FEAR of a party losing ..
Absolute BOLLOCKS.
For a country that has a lot of guns and who shoot a lot not 1 of them can shoot straight
Ok
2:20 the bug on his shoulder lol
"Again downplaying it , and always from the same tribe. This just tells you  he on the  road to winning. This inside work."
"The left are terrified of this man, they called him racist, but then we seen pictures of him with all the great black leaders, he even won an award for helping black people that was awarded to him by Rosa Parks, even Mike Tyson couldn’t believe they called trump racist, then they called him a rapist but there was absolutely no evidence so it didn’t go anywhere , then a pedophile simply because he loves his daughter so much. they rigged his Election, they then impeach him but that didn’t stop him, they then called him a Russian asset and said he spied on Hillary‘s campaign, so the FBI looked into it and all they found was that Obama spied on Trump‘s campaign, they then said he paid people off for sex, they then raided his home, they then arrested him, they then took him to court twice, all that failed so they shot him in the face, that still failed as he raised his fist, and now they have shot at him again, the left want him deleted so bad, they won’t stop,  and that’s a sure sign he’s doing good,, the only sad thing is he will NEVER become president again, they will rig it again even more so this time, they will try and delete him, if that doesn’t work next is the rigging"
I swear something fishy 🐠 about this . I can’t trust media anymore most probably a red flag 🚩 to win over the public
The left are clearly the problem here!
This guy is a huge problem for this country. The country will be at peace once he loses in November
He also said in the email to supporters “I will always love you for supporting me. Unity. Peace. Make America Great Again.”. BBC trying their best to appear impartial
There is a large insect at about 2 10 crawling up the commentators right shoulder.
"Full 111% Safety and Security, Defense and Protection for President Trump now!"
"Y'know, I dunno why, but I'm starting to think some people don't really like this Trump fellow."
Funny how No Network is reporting on this?  Oh wait it’s because the Dems are running them!!!  Wake up America.
The Democrats all behind it to win elections. I pray God builds a protection around President Trump.
Wow they really are doing anything to take him outta this world. Sounds like their scared he may win.
"Multiple shots in the bush while between holes.

Trump says he feels his swing is probably the best anyone has ever seen. Infact many have commented on it.

Glad he is ok👍....this world without a Trump....impossible."
I just find this all very strange given how long he’s been around… all of a sudden it’s open season? I wouldn’t rule out a perverse PR attempt to make him look like some kind of Kennedy.
"I have to say, this is politically counterproductive. Why? Because half the US population believe the exact opposite of anything. "
Haha he's trying to get popular again lol
"Happens every day...what to say...
Did he duck the bullet?...
Are his ducks ok?...nobody talking about the ducks any more..."
"These assassination attempts are entirely the fault of the left wing politicians and media, saying wildly untrue things like he'll be the next Hitler (he was already president - he didn't do anything remotely Hitler like in office). This wild rhetoric causes unhinged leftists to literally commit murder. Everyone needs to wake up, smarten up and grow up."
"It seems like Malania don't care who finds out now she's not willing to go thru 4 more years of this BS, so is trying to end it b4 it starts 😂"
Trumps ears are gonna end up more pierced than a punk rocker 😂
This is becoming a trend!
Excellent coverage. Better than the garbage from US media
"Another ""assassination attempt""? Isn't it strange how they only ever happen when he experiences a dip in the polls, and they never cause him harm (unless he has a magical, regenerating ear)? 🤔"
Doesn’t get much luck does he Jesus
The wild wild west!!!
Trump staging these assassination attempts to win sympathy
Democrat leaders with their hateful rhetoric are 100% responsible for this and it will likely not be the last time. Obama's puppets need to be held accountable by Law Enforcement.
“I’m still standing better than I ever did.”
Land of the free aye? Just as long as you dont disagree with specific political views aye?
democrats really tryna kill the guy
"These wants to kill TRUMP :

1) Democrats of US + FBI 
2) NATO + European Union 
2.1 ) BBC is part of 2 
3) Iran 

Only because elite can have all the money & wealth. B*****ds."
They sure don't want him to be elected again.
"Picture this - some guy is firing at trees, tRump's such a coward he thinks it's about him 
😂😂 Dude is an absolute pussy."
Is the main stream media reporting truth for a change?  Hmmmm
Meanwhile all Kamala is interested in is debating this man. Doesn't condemn the attempt on his life. He made a comment about it at the last debate and she didn't say anything. She's classless and clueless all at the same time
"Im engIish and dont know much about firearms but that seems like a long way for an AK with a scope... Maybe its doable if you're really well practised and theres no wind or something?! But it seems like a bolt-action is what youd be after, right? Isnt 7.62 a really heavy round thats not moving (comparatively) very fast? 

Good old donald. Like neo in the matrix. But orange."
Is that a cockroach or a moth or something that's crawling all over the presenter in the last few seconds of the video? lol
but it's the right that is somehow extreme isn't it?
Pls stop campaigning!!! You will win if you stay alive.
Fraudster trump may have stage a hoax like that to win votes of pity or victim
"*media constantly demonizes and depicts Trump as the end of democracy*

*Deranged nut tries to take action*

""Seems fishy to me guys""

Just like last time, right?"
"Trump's such a pussy ngl, just wow. 😂😂😂😂"
"Absolute garbage, the man is so desperate for votes. BBC trusting the FBI for accurate information?????"
"This whole situation just feels so surreal, like something out of a movie, right? 🎬 I wonder how many layers there are to this story that we don’t even know about yet. Makes you think about how crazy things can get in the world of politics. 😬"
Just another publicity stunt from that stinking orange lying POS TRAITOR! Those 'gun shots' weren't anywhere near that orange MOFO! He's already got a grift going from it!!! I call BULLSH*T ....
"The 🌎 is a stage
Enjoy the movie 🎬"
"again ,lol they really don't want him to win do they"
How can he be trusted to secure the border if he can't even secure his own golf course?
Apparently all of his enemies are stormtroopers
2 attempts and bro still is standing strong
Did anyone see that bug on the reports right shoulder....lol
What has trump done to deserve this? I'm sure im gonna get a list from someone but I wonder if the world thinks Putin is more...worth the effort?
First world country KEK
Why are people talking more about the butterfly than the fact that trump almost got shot again?
The first one had better TV ratings
b safe the don father 🙏
"many on the left are extremists, with no sense of reason, compassion, dark hearts"
The clue is in the word apparent assassination... wouldn't be surprised to learn that this is Trumps people trying to gain the narrative back from Kamala Harris... assassination did so well for him last time.
"Trump before: “it didn’t work the way I wanted with the first guy. What a shaaame.
We need more votes, make it real this time, but don’t kill me 0okay? …What a great guy”. Trump post assination: “ That assassin is a bad guy… what a bad Guy.. .How could he miss?”"
Yahhh it was another assasination attempt lol why even try making statements questioning that.
"If it happens once it's a huge shock. It's awful that that man was killed during that rally. If it happens twice? No, this is just even more suspicious than the first time. Private golf course, SS security ramped up substantially after the first attempt, and this time it's someone hiding in the woods at an even greater distance? I'm definitely going conspiracy theorist on this when I say that this has to be some kind of ploy to garner failing support and increase donations for his campaign from his loyal cultists. There's no way this shit happens twice man.

Edit: Lol he actually used this as a way to ask for more donations. This shit is just stupid predictable."
lol wtf
Why does he keep saying apparently? Hmm 😒
"Of course, getting rid of Trump will give his political party a chance at winning, as it is now, the laughing clown woman will most likely win, so getting rid of Orange Man will maybe stop that. You really have to laugh at American politics, it really is a comedy of clowns and jesters. And, how shit are American assassins these days ?"
What now? his right ear ?
They are really after him.
"I predict this might become a recurrent occurrence until the election. I mean, he can't win debates, needs to build up a messianic reputation or some shite... Oof, Muricah...."
He’s safe? Fuuuuuccccckkkkk!!!!!!!
"""an AK-47 assult rifle has apparently been recovered"" - is this journalism or speculation? Why not stick to the facts and what can be verified."
"For some reason I'm reminded of a great line in the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" film where Ken Foree's character picks up an expensive rifle in the mall's gun-shop, peers down the scope, and says ""The only guy who could miss with this is the guy who could afford it."""
The Democrats are most definitely behind this
"If only the good die young, and Donald is pushing 80 and has survived 2 president-level assassination attempts, does that make him Satan?

Bill Hicks said Reagan was Satan and he survived an attempt. What does that make Donald?"
How many shootings of us presidents or ex presidents ….need to get rid of guns .lbut UzsAxwhen are you going to realise your lack 9f gun laws cause gun violence
"Somebody really doesn’t want this guy in power…

What are they hiding???"
More Bull Shit
We wont see this covered at all lol
"The Anti-Trump comments
here are all from BBC shills
The pro-Trump comments 
are all from ordinary people 
Trump is Winning ✊😻✊"
Democrats are completely unhinged.
"How can you report this. This has already been debunked as rot, it is total lies. It had nothing, NOTHING whatever to do with Trump with the incident way outside the vicinity of where he was. His propergander lunatic Stephen Cheung [utout this rubbish to deflect and give sensational headlines to steer people away from the fact that he is waning in USA. Trump should disappear full stop! Lunatic!"
"Hilarious how the same sheeple who cry ""conspiracy theory!"" every time anyone questions the political establishment are acting like deranged schizos about these assassination attempts.

Its like these NPC's will only believe whatever the globalist establishment wants them to believe."
"Why does the far left always use violence to silence democracy? The so called far right haven't tried to assassinate Joe Biden, though that's probably because no one would even notice the difference!"
When is this going to stop? How many times must the far left try to murder Trump before we have a serious discussion about the threat that far left terror poses to our democracy?
Will the deep state remain silent after Trump wins
"The left are really trying to kill this guy... its so clear that he messes with ""their plans"" they're agenda. Wild"

Ah the BBC.....from greatest news in history to left wing propaganda wing.
"Bug appears @2:02 mins in.  Just saw the bug, on his shoulder, crawling down the right side of his suit jacket. 🪲🦋"
The ones pulling the strings really don't want Trump in power. He's a threat to their nefarious plans.
Seems like he really isnt liked after all
Wow. The side of loving and tolerance sure can't seem to accept the undeniable truth of trump becoming preisdent 😅😅
"This is heavy, I can't wonder what election day will be like, stay safe everyone"
Trump needs more security
IMHO BBC are full of communist and peados

"he got so much attention last time, and totally lost the debate!  He needed something to turn the attention back on him - REMEMBER, HE'S A MALIGNANT NARCISSIT!  It worked once , why not try again?  Just look, its all over the media right now.  He's thriving off this atm"
The same FBI that needs 66yrs to release the data from Seth Rich's laptop are the same people investigating the assassination attempt! I'm sure we'll get the TRUTH!👌
everyone wants to kill rapist & racist trump
His poll numbers are slipping and all of a sudden another “ assassination attempt “….. yeah ok
"At least he had someone to protect him school kids don’t .If he got into power wouldn’t this be a great incentive to ban guns .""Of. Course not money always comes first."
Cockroach straight on he’s sleeve 😮
"Trump must know who will benefit from his death, the question how many lives he has but all respect to Trump for going through all that just to see a fair election in America. I am sure Biden is relieved that Trump is face 😂"
welcome to F LA trump don't you know anything goes
The left really dont want this man in power. That's how you know he's the man to vote for. They cant win politically so will try to get him in a way like this.
"Everyone love him, and him will end this war, but  it's in the way of.... People.  Trump its a problem for this world but not a problem for the people.
Trump its a business man and him know well what it's doing"
How about not missing next time.
Trying to go up in the polls. Probably a fan or someone working for ruSSia trying to help him win by staging a shooting. Two shootings is too fishy.
"Oh but, but, but… “The Democrats aren’t responsible.” Sure, and Willy didn’t get a blowy from Monica in the Oval Office."
I wonder if we'll move on from this as fast as we moved on from the first attempt
"Newsflash, Reality and Wake-up Call For Trump:
1) the list of SHOOTERS trying to assassinate TRUMP are from his own WHITE RACE. HA-HA-HA-HA! Because certain people from his own white race feel he has let them down in some BIG way or betrayed them, so they will not stop until he is dead.
2) The interesting fact is, there are corrupt white secret service and other whites close to Trump who he interacts with who want him dead. So, Trump is constantly having to look over his shoulder at his (OWN WHITE People) HA-HA-HA, because he knows the chances of an assassination on him, allowed from his own White Secret Service and other specific whites is 100%.
2)  so the burning question: if the white person who assassinates Trump, will he be a white KKK, or a white Neo-Nazi or a white Supremacist, or a Far Right White Extremist, remember, all created and kept thriving to this day by the evil, racist white race.

3) so if the white person assassinates Trump will it be a hate-filled white Republican or a hate-filled white Democrat?
4) It’s a known fact WORLDWIDE, Trump is a racist and narcissist, fortunately he can’t blame these assassination attempts on racism, because HE KNOWS there are so many, many whites in his own race, who want him dead. 
5) I would make a guess that, Trump is getting a lot more death threats the closer and closer the election date approaches."
What if the gunman stuck his head out of the bushes to takes a shot at the same moment Trump took his shot and the ball hit him on his head and knocked him out...gunman would sue Trump and Trump would be up on charges! Ahhhh only in 'America the land of the free'!

Crazy. I don’t do politics but dude needs better security and all. This whole thing is getting out of hand
I speak for all Black Americans we gotta do better protecting the plug 🔌   Trump 2024
"Again! Really? Again.,,,."
They are worried trump will win...
I pray he is elected in November. It will be so sweet.
Oh no! I hope he’s ok.
Is Trump now the most shot at Presidential Candidate  ?  Amazingly he's so fat n slow they can't get a head shot
Don’t give up your arms American friends. Best from Wales.

Will Radical Marxist Democrats Kommiela Harris and Tampon Timmy give Democrat Assassin Ryan Wesley Routh Free Bail Funds?
"The suspect was out of range and didn't fire a single shot.  Any and all shots fired were fired by the secret service.  To call it an ""assassination attempt"" is mislabeling.  It's an assassination plot at best, as no actual attempt was made."
The liberals and the left are the real danger to democracy
Democrats can't win through fair elections. And the states are refusing to allow mail in ballots and post-election day ballot counts so they can't steal the election again as easily. So they have to do it this way.
Left wings really are the true terrorists these days
Clear and concise reporting. Ty
"More security, that means that we pay for that security if everybody likes Donald Trump the way he says that everybody likes him he shouldn’t have so much security"
Ya right. Just like last time. He'll do anything to try and win this election.
The comments section tells it all. Left-wingers think an attempt to KILL SOMEONE (they don't agree with) is funny ha-ha? They are Demoncrits 👿
Why they shooting….he is going to lose in 2 months and will be GONE for good
"They'd just said that there were gunshots, but then calls it an apparent shooting.You said there were gunshots.Bro, that's not a parent.That's just a shooting, not an apparent shooting.Stop lying and twisting facts"
ak-47 with a scope? lol?
The problem is the left and the media spewing lies about Trump becoming a dictator and project 2025. The constant lying has to stop!
"Well, Kamala trying her best."
OK so....the guy was there to kill Trump. Met police force outside the golf course. Fire was exchanged and he fled dropping the gun into a nearby bush. Police drones located the suspect fleeing on a vehicle and he was arrested. That is all we know so far. This time they got the guy BEFORE he had Trump on his crosshairs. Better than last time. Any leftist saying it was not an attempt on his life is a moron.
Okay guys it’s getting old now
It's not the place or the moment but there's a giant bug walking on your right shoulder.
"YouTube not going to censor any comments on this one. All the Trump and America haters, feel free to express your views and Google/YouTube got your back with their social forum."
"Golf Cart RAGE? … Another MAGA nut job trying to take potshots at Dementia DonOLD and this is breaking news?  … Most normal Americans are saying “ you just gotta get over it, it’s a fact of life”. (Quoting Republican talking points after recent shooting massacres). SMH .."
"They can't Arrest and imprison him so they are going to kill him, they aren't going to stop, The panic and desperation couldn't be any more obvious"
"Have to chuckle at all comments against Trump and their conspiracy theories. Keep going -- the more you banter about Trump, the more Trump stays in the spotlight! "
"Yeaaa ok,, that’s a fixed deal he knows can’t get presidential house and need an excuse to fell victim,, topical Narcissist acccions"
Stop Making yourself available to assassins You keep sticking your ass out there Keep sticking your ass out there and someone's gonna get You keep sticking your ass out there and someone's gonna get lucky I thought you had a better IQ than that
Distractions. Trump is losing. A lot of drama. Don’t believe what’s happening out there.   Trump not going back to the White House.  Lies chaos and more chaos. He is very upset Taylor swift chose Kamala. Stop with the drama Trump and Vance. Both of you not going to the White House. It belongs to the people.
Think this is telling old white and privileged men to just  retire and enjoy your last days on this Earth.
"Huge bug on reporter. Ew. That's the story here for me. Take a bath, dude"

All seeing eye trying to drop this guy asap before he gets elected 😂😂 people are so dumb if you don’t think they’re is a higher power controlling everything. All these characters on TV are nothing more than yes CHARACTERS
Why aren't you identifying the roach on his shoulder (2:00-2:25)? We expect full disclosure!

Local rich people and government want Trump out of Palm Beach
Can you say fishy for real this is to cover up the debate hello there's nobody tricked by this🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lies and schemes again😂
This is such a free publicity stunt...Trump is broke donations are down.
"Ironically isn't it a constitutional right of all US Citizens to have the right to bear arms , so that each may have the ability to form a militia and defend itself against the threat of external argession / tyranny of authoritarianism from Central Govt, would seem that this is no more than a pre-emptive action against what the Tango Orangutan n his Project 25 playbook has clearly stated as an assault on the Republican ideals upon which the US was founded .... seems like he called it .... DISCUSS"
Stay at the beach to be safe.
They really don’t want this man to win the presidency
Democrats really desperate lol
"So many people still don't get it. People still think this election is about things like abortion, and border control. If you still think Trump is the devil in all of this, you need to wake tf up."
Hi own people trying to boost his ratings or someone else trying to save their country
"Got beaten by Harris in the last debate. 

Another attempted assassination. I'm sure his ratings will go up again. 

Remember the  previous assassination attempt was done by a registered Republican. 

🤔"
Huge moth on his shoulder.
The peaceful left.
At this point someone haas to get the messege right? Just saying
The glaring difference between the left and the right. The left is morally backward.
Their trying to stop him winning the election and taking over the country for the better. Donald trump will not go down !!! FCUK the left side
"Democrats want him cold bad lol... they are so weak right now its not even a joke...... they wont be showing this starting next week and will not play anything on this for along long time after the election lol... the news are all owned by one entity, lol go down the rabbit whole and findout yourself,"
The far right again I’ll bet.
Another hoax from the Trump campaign. Just like the first one.
Far left radicals
"⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️LOL!!!! ALWAYS A """"""""AK-47"""""""" ALWAYS DURRING ELECTION YEARS I NEVER HEAR THE WORDS """"""AK-47"""""" SO MUCH!!! LOL HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP! 2 PEOPLE WERE SHOOTING AT EACHOTHER OUTSIDE HIS GOLF RESORT AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP!!! IM SO DA*M SICK AND TIRED OF THESE PUBLICLY STUNTS BY TRUMPS CRASHING AND BURNING CAMPAIGN! SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT THAT! WHO WOULD RECORD THEIR OWN CRIME OF ASSASSINATION W A GO PRO! WHAT WAS THE PLAN? UPLOAD IT TO FACEBOOK?!?"
"Starting to think the left might not be the lovely ""sending good vibez!!!"" people they claim they are..."
Looks like he isnt loving israel enough....
Dude went to Tucson Arizona and nothing would even happen to him... What kind of jiggaboosmethupshytisthis
"Okay, does this seem suspicious at all? A second attempt and they miss again? With an Ak-47? Hmm... with secret service all around on his own property? Something smells very fishy to me. Trump def set this up for attention and sympathy. There is just no way there could possibly be someone on his property with an AK-47 who just got past all his secret service officers. What a crock of you know what!"
"The NRA""s new America is welcoming Trump over and over again...."
Wow the demos are just trying to start a civil war
"What is going on? I need to get tf out of this country. It’s entirely too easy for people in this country to access firearms. 2 assassination attempts on a former president, how? Like what is going on?"
What happened to god being on his side and guns being a good thing?
"Popular guy, Donny😅"
"Really ? Would that be another gun-obsessed , NRA -type person ? Like the last one . Who are mostly , traditionally ,Trump supporters. Funny, given that he is losing , that all the bullets seem to be going his way  and also given he is the pro-NRA candidate . You would imagine the opposite would be a lot more likely. The first attempt stretched my credulity .This one strings it out like well-chewed gum . It's losing its flavour now , Donald ."
What on earth was the bug crawling all over his right shoulder???
THANK YOU BBC FOR BEING HONEST IN YOUR HEADLINE!!!!… BRAVO!!!!👏🏽
Donald will win no matter what
"Interesting that the right who are considered “extremists” aren’t attempting to assassinate KH, but the left???? They are “normal”….."
"Far left extremism, what has the world come to. national socialists American workers party member?"
"Funny that as hes losing in the polls, worked first time for poll ratings so try again?"
"Almost like all those celebrities and people joking about the first attempt and telling people to ""not miss next time"" was a call to arms"
People trying to kill trump because trump is the real deal
Trump 2024 for president. Thank you Jesus DJT is safe 🙏🙏✝️✝️✝️✝️
Omg I hope he is ok? 😳
It’s almost as if people really don’t like him
"Let us all remember the ""late, great"" Jim Jones faked an assassination attempt to gain sympathy with his followers. Next, they all drank fruit punch. I will laugh so hard if the old orange one starts selling Jesus Juice by the bottle. It's coming, folks. Stay tuned. He's running out of merch to grift."
Who the fuck puts a Scope on an AK-47 LOL
"Left and right, suck it. You all suck.  😂"
trump better start wearing a protective suit
"Assassination attempt my arse. This scam is so played out. It is nothing more than a distraction. 
Are we supposed to have one of these every 2 weeks? Should VP Harris have one as well? 
We in America are so tired of this man and his BS. Here you are talking about this shyte again instead of him being unfit to be POTUS. 

we are not buying this convenient ""attempted assassination"" BS again."
Trumper   or not this is unacceptable in America . Imagine if this was a candidate from the democrats. Party some cities will be right now in flames.
Yeah right
"Trumps heading to the top, deus vult this man will become presiden! Hopefully put a stop to some of the madness with Starlimer and the rest of Liebour."
"So much garbage reporting, first it was one shot,now police say they fired multiple times at the suspect."
"Really, is he worried about Swifts endorsement and needs to pull something out of a hat?"
Your local reporter is full of shit. If you are not going to report the facts then don't bother.
"Just goes to show how insane the left are, everyday those hardcore news agencies like msnbc, ABC, CNN are constantly talking about how Trump is going to destroy democracy, how Trump is going to create some form of dictatorship, how Trump is some kind of nazi. They want this to happen, the hardcore left are absolute extremists who will riot and cause harm as we have seen with the black lives matter, antifa, etc. 

When the FBI and all of the democratic government are out to try to take this man down, from outright lying about him to trying to put him in jail, you can damn well believe that they are trying to kill this guy. You know that Trump is the one that should be winning, especially when the mainstream is going this insane over him potentially winning. Especially when you have so many young individuals out there that are extremely naive being brainwashed into thinking this guy is some kind of nazi, what the United States right now needs is trump. He isn't part of their plan, he isn't going to allow these borders to remain open so that you can lose your country and people who are still loyal to other countries will shut down the United States from the inside out.

He's going to thin out government by firing all those radical extremists that are simply destroying the country for a paycheck, and of course they are all shivering in their tiny little boots at the known fact that they are going to lose everything.

You want the United States back? Get Trump as your president. He will not be some puppet to other individuals, the guys already got millions upon millions of dollars so he doesn't bend over backwards for those bribes, he's the only president that has had zero Wars start while he was president in the past 40 years, he allowed the younger generation to be able to afford homes more so than any other president over the past 40 years, this guy will bring back the love for the United States and stop enforcing extremists ideologies on everyone.

But simply because he is not part of the plan, not part of the agenda and he should not be winning according to the left, they are going to try and take him out and since the jailing method did not work it looks like they are trying to get him killed."
Is he gone lol
I guess this is exactly the defence of democratic rights that republicans advocate?

Jesus Died for and paid the price for all the sins we will ever commit in our life time, so that it would be possible for sinners like us to make it to Heaven in the presence of a perfect God. After 3 days He Rose from the dead to show us all that not even death can beat or hold him. Jesus is Not your Enemy, He gave his life for you and I which Is the greatest way to show you Love someone. Accepting Jesus means you accept that he paid for your sins with his life and you are blame free and will have everlasting life with God in Heaven. Not Accepting Jesus means you don't accept that he paid for your sins with his life and you will have to pay fir every sin you ever committed yourself, and those sins payments are hell. I am not your enemy, I do not come with words of hate or death, I come with words of Love and Life. Jesus is the only way to God and Heaven. God's spirit came down in the Flesh of a man and that is Jesus, God's Spirit dwells in Jesus body, they are One, just like you and I have a spirit in our body and our spirit is inside our body, but that dosnt make us 2 entity's or 2 different people, its still one Me and One You. It is the same with God and Jesus. All you have to do be saved is Accept Jesus by believing Confessing Jesus is Lord, and you will be saved and have everlasting life. 🙏🏽✌🏽❤️"
But they keep missing. Or is this all political just for more votes.
"**Shooting Incident Poses Questions Amid Trump Debate Fallout**

The aftermath of the recent debate between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris has taken an unexpected and dramatic turn. What began as a widely ridiculed political exchange has now spiraled into a national security crisis, with a shooting incident at a golf course where Trump was present raising serious questions about how classified information was leaked—and who might have been responsible.

The debate itself was seen as a disaster for Trump. His performance, marred by awkward exchanges and questionable remarks, was panned by both political analysts and the public alike. One of the most criticized moments came when Trump made a statement about the current administration ""eating cats and dogs,"" which quickly went viral on social media. Memes flooded the internet, and the next day's headlines were unrelenting. Early polls indicated a sharp drop in Trump's approval ratings, and even some members of his inner circle expressed concern that the debate could mark a turning point in his political career—and not in his favor.

However, the fallout from the debate took a sudden turn when a shooting occurred at a golf course where Trump was making a public appearance. According to reports, the shooter, an average local citizen, had managed to breach security at the event. What has stunned investigators, though, is the revelation that the shooter possessed classified information about Trump’s exact location—details typically only known to a small group of high-level security personnel.

This breach has left many wondering how such sensitive information could have fallen into the hands of an outsider. The Secret Service, known for its stringent protocols, was quick to open an investigation, and the FBI has also joined efforts to determine the source of the leak. But even as law enforcement agencies work around the clock to trace the origins of the breach, one question looms large: could this incident have been more than just a random act of violence?

For many, the timing of the shooting is suspicious. Just hours before the attack, Trump had been the subject of widespread mockery following his debate performance. Media outlets were intensely focused on his gaffes, and the internet was awash with memes poking fun at his comments. Then, just as the criticism reached a fever pitch, the shooting shifted the national conversation. Suddenly, the focus was no longer on Trump’s debate missteps, but on the security breach and the potential danger he faced.

This has led some political insiders and observers to speculate whether the incident might have been orchestrated. Could the shooting have been a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from Trump’s poor debate performance? Such conspiracy theories, while unproven, have begun to gain traction among those who believe the timing is too convenient to be coincidental.

Trump’s history of media manipulation has only added fuel to these theories. Throughout his career, Trump has been known for his ability to control the narrative, shift focus away from his missteps, and dominate the news cycle. For his critics, the shooting appears to fit this pattern. They argue that the incident could have been a calculated move designed to overshadow the negative coverage following the debate and recast Trump as a sympathetic figure facing serious threats.

According to these theories, the shooting wasn’t just a random act by a lone gunman—it was a staged spectacle, orchestrated to change the narrative. If true, the implications are staggering: someone within Trump’s circle, or with access to high-level classified information, may have coordinated the leak to the shooter in order to create a diversion.

Law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service and the FBI, are now conducting a full-scale inquiry to trace the source of the classified information. They are focusing on how the shooter gained access to details about Trump’s exact location, and whether there was a breach from within Trump’s security team or a mole feeding information to the attacker.

As the investigation continues, the political fallout from the incident is growing. Trump’s critics have seized on the timing, suggesting that this is another example of the former president’s ability to manipulate the media and shift attention away from his own failings. They argue that the shooting incident, whether orchestrated or not, has successfully distracted the public from Trump’s debate debacle, and redirected focus to a more sympathetic narrative—one that frames him as a target of violence and opposition.

On the other side, Trump’s supporters have dismissed the conspiracy theories as baseless and absurd. They argue that the focus should remain on the real issue at hand: the security breach and how classified information was leaked to the shooter. For them, the incident is a stark reminder of the dangers Trump continues to face and the political opposition that seeks to discredit him at every turn.

Regardless of which side of the political spectrum one falls on, one fact remains clear: the shooting has shifted the national conversation. The debate, which just days ago dominated the headlines, has now taken a back seat to the investigation into the breach and the security risks surrounding Trump.

As investigators work to uncover the source of the classified information, the questions surrounding the incident grow. Was this shooting simply an unfortunate coincidence, or was it part of a more calculated plan to divert attention from Trump’s political woes? And most importantly, who had access to such sensitive information, and how did it fall into the wrong hands?

As the investigation unfolds, the answers to these questions remain elusive. For now, the nation watches and waits, wondering just how deep this conspiracy might go—and what it might reveal about the intersections of politics, security, and manipulation."
"Your lies are the cause, but the truth about anything right now is censored"
Is this prearranged attempt to get the sympathy from the public to win in the election?
"I thought Americans where very experienced with guns, but but couldn't hit a barn door?"
"such a shame, 3rd time lucky guys???"
How many dramas to go until the election??
"Come on BBC, get it right, an AR47 is NOT an assault rifle."
This is another attempt to make Trump relevant. We are all going to find out that it was a republican white man who tried to kill him. He was paid to make the attempt.
They realy don't want him alive
Wall to Wall news coverage......more important happenings in the world ffs.....
He wants world peace. Too many powerful people will lose too much money if he wins and brokers peace with Russia.
Of course Trump was safe. The shooting was between to individuals outside the golf course.
This is another attempt to make Trump relevant. We are all going to find out that it was a republican white man who tried to kill him. He was paid to make the attempt.
Wild man
So Harris kicks his ass in the latest debate and Trump trying for the sympathy vote part 2.
They really do want him gone.
There has been now two assassination attempts they are trying to lock him up bankrupt him and all he wants to do is help America and the American people I would have given up a long time ago I don't understand what keeps him going.
I'm guessing he was another straight white gunloving Republican just like last time.
America is iconic democratic republican country in the world. If any bullshit or any bullshit organization behind this act can come forward and defeat him in the election. I hope American will come forward to save their democracy.🙏🙏
"How many time will they try to kill this man. Come on people loonies, just leave him alone. Prayer for President Trump ❤️"
"Oh brother. Another ""attempt"" that is completely and utterly incompetent. Assassination attempts ain't what they used to be. IF this was a genuine attempt in the first place. Which I seriously doubt."
What lovely people's Democrat voters on the left are
Many men
What the hell is happening in the  US ? What kind of example is this setting for American democracy in the world that they are claiming to run? Is this the end of US supremacy ? Obviously there are more questions than answers...
2:04 - Congrats to that uninvited guest on the reporters shoulder! (That Fly)
Anyone see the bug on the reporter? Absolutely huge
"Remember, the media continue to say Trump is a threat to democracy.

And then play Pikachu surprised face when people try to kill him.

How is the last decade not one big incitement to violence the way they have purosefully maligned Trump?"
"Because trumph mouth is always looks like a women , nagging and nagging  . Always pointing to someone . Trump has so many enemy , so authority cannot prevent any attempt to trumph"
Man somebody please tell this old man to stop the Cap! He just want attention. Grow up you grown af😂
How many ears is he gonna magically regrow this time?
"We know to expect this. 😢

When you go to bed tonight, please be grateful you are in Britain. Think of that, right before you go to sleep."
"Fake news LOL Welll there you go, LOL, tRump issss a liar, whiner, loser, cheater, fraud, and coward along with his maga Congress and supreme court. Traitors.Oh yeah and FOX, News, LOL"
"I think the response to gun violence is to ""get over it""  per Donnie himself.   Why all the fuss?  A dude with a gun in a deep red state full of god fearin, 2nd Amendment patriots.  Must have been poaching gators or something like that."
"Wow, Dump is desperate for air time! More lies, now watch him blame democrats, immigrants, aliens, Bin Laden 😂 The guys a FREAKSHOW!! Flush the Dump.....FDJT✌🏼💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿"
So many trolfarm comments here! From Ruzzia with love ... for Trump.
Funny how they keep missing.
"The first time… probably legit…
2nd time… looking for votes? Suspect was probably a Trump junior.."
wokies cannot win god is on trumps side lmao
"The tiniest bit of me feels this is a setup to get some sympathy. He got his arse handed to him in his debate, and has since refused to do another. This is a good way to bring some popularity back. 
In reality I don’t really think that but it will likely have the desired effect. This isnt to open debate, I don’t care about other opinions, just sharing my thoughts."
Lol maybe if they worked on the gun laws then this wouldn't happen🤷🏻
Thank you for letting people know he’s ok.  None of the other channels did that.
"Lord, watch over the president and his family and keep them safe 🙏"
"Trump is the most hood leader in the world. Felon, got 3 baby mommas, got caught cheating with a porn star, got shot at twice and he still kicking it."
"As much as Americans love their guns, they are sure lousy shots."
People on the 'right' fair game in this 'democratic' west?
Man stood professional with a bug on his shoulder clearly making him nervous.
"Sleepy Joe's supporters are really getting desperate now. They are terrified that Donald Trump WILL win the election.
FJB, Trump 2024!!"
"Another set up fake ""assassination"",  all set up by "" yours truly"" all to win the sympathy of the American people"
Many men......
"One just never knows what to believe when it comes to America. Drama, real life, theatre for the masses or what 🙄🤔😏"
JD vance said shootings are just a part of life. So it’s best that we ignore this and move on.
"Cmon yanks, a whole country full of highly armed maniacs and the one time none of em can seem to shoot straight when it comes to this guy...
well the last lad was a registered republican, lets see what happens this time XD"
This feels very much like a set up so he can gain some votes
What was the gunman’s name Lee Harvey Oswald? Come on Donald stop creating these Scenarios to gain more support and votes! Just get your publicity team to write a few more offensive tweets
Democrats really trying to start a civil war out here 🤦‍♂️
Did you see that gigantous bug walking on his shoulder? Where did he go? LOL 😱🤣
They’re trying to give him some momentum in the polls lol
Look at the size of that cockroach on his right shoulder (the reporter)!
“We don’t know for sure if he was the main target……” -Msm
The media are the blame of this. Spreading hatred against trump. Brainwashing innocent people to then create issues like this!.
How ironic the Republican candidate is providing the strongest argument for gun control
"Strange ain't it BBC?

If Heels-up Harris , a a cert to win, why shoot at Trump?"
School shootings and shooting president's are very popular in your country! Crazy Americans...
Remove women's rights to vote for they haven't earned this right through blood
It was a shooting near the course. Trump was not involved nor the target.
"..ermm, ""againnnnnn""..????!!!! Wow. 😅"
"The elites want him gone, they have had a good time with dosy joe and don't want him in charge coming after them."
funny part was he was talking about AK-47 two days ago
The butterfly: “Mom I’m on TV :D”
Tell me he isn't staging these for publicity with a straight face and I'll show you a total rube.
How many assassination attempts is Trump going to pay for?
Don’t attempt a coup in a democracy and this wouldn’t be happening. I hope all the kids in schools are safe today.
"Are demonrats getting desperate? In any fair election, Kamala with her demonic laughter outbursts, ongoing lies, and questionable IQ has zero chances to win."
Set up to win sympathy votes.
"Oh one of their favorite guns 
This is absurd. He is capable of doing all of this for attention.
Get a grip people. He is doing anything he can to take focus off him. Whatever 
He is such a liar."
It’s kind of ironic as a European descendant that Kamala Harris is still alive to be honest with you.
"How have I not heard about this from an American news source? This is wild, a second attempt on his life already. His opponents and their supporters are getting unhinged at this point."
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING OWN!
"Everyone stopped caring about the first one almost immediately, so they decided to try again."
"Jesus christ, twice they failed.. 😂 what happened to the good ole JFK days ? This is what happens when you allow LBGQTYUCG and whatever other fridge they wanna identify as 😂😂💀"
"Damn, they really don’t like him"
"The ‘Muricans have so many guns, yet they only seem to be able to shoot children."
How true is it. If so they missed him again. ?
New world order really trying hard
"Trump is the one who heavily support to have own crazy rifles. I think, it is just another attempt to clean his image."
"An AK-47? For a country that has more guns than people, the USA appears to have the most inept would-be assassins in the world."
What kind of Mickey Mouse operation are they running?
Many men. Maany many many men….
They really don't want him to win this election aye
"Vladimir Putin is behind this, He wants kamala to win so women empowerment will empower, Dominate & Destroy AMERICA so his country can be the World Super Power | PSYCHIC READING 🔮"
Gun control sounds a lot better now doesn't Donny?
It'll turn out to be another publicity stunt to help him get more votes.
FBI latest: “attempt on Donald Trump assassination”
People rly trynna prevent him from becoming president 😂😂😂
Crazy whats going on. Why cant things just be done fairly.  Rigged elections attempted assassinations. 🤷‍♂️.  Nothing can be trusted anymore
"Trump is so desperate he staged his very own assassination attempt because VP Harris tore him a new one at the debate. This is all he has no polices , ideas are plans for America everything for himself."
Lol agaiiiin???? Guys aren't u tired
"Trump is needed to save the world.
Its so messed up right now with snowflakes.
The man is ""the you know who resurrected""...
Go trump."
Was he hunting cats and dogs? or was it Alec Baldwin filming a movie? But I really am surprised that Trump was golfing.
"What's the big deal
The guy was exercising his right to bear arms
It was an assault rifle
They use those for hunting...right?
Nothing to worry about ""it's a fact of life"" remember?
Besides - it's too soon to talk about
Lots of thoughts - zero prayers"
Confirmed that the shooter is a man named Sam hyde
More lies.
lol America
The previous incident got him a lot of popularity so they've staged it again to make the SS look effective and get Trump some sympathy votes. Dogs and cats didn't get the momentum so they're trying this again.
I was always told the left are peaceful
How can nobody get close to putin but this guys just dancing to Many Men in the least secure places
Another paid failed attempt! Trump arranged this to get more votes!! 🤦🏼
"Many men, many many many men"
"USSS protects. Best way to protect is to keep protectee out of danger.  Donald The Trump prefers the great outdoor for both rallies and obviously golf.  First protectee who basically tells USSS ""No,"" and does it ""My Way.""  I woud say he is USSS biggest pain in the arse to protect. Now he get to play victim and he gets a mulligan on the cats and dog thing on the news."
"😂😂😂 welcome to the land of the free 😂😂😂

Backwards country and nation"
Better luck next time.
"It's Pretty clear now 

Dark dark country being run by sociopaths"
more bs
"What are they scared of!?? If Kamala apparently going to win the western media keeps telling us, why are they trying to silence him??"
"These gunmen don't really need to go to this trouble. He's not going to win the election...so unless this is a false indication and warning op you're not helping. And government is likely better at security than you are a one-man assault element. Anyway, two-party collapse would laid bare what is already the case. The first failure was an opportunist. What is rationale this time? Too much incompetence with access to firearms but I honestly don't think we can solve it by restricting access. I want to protect me and mine. We need to bring back competence and self-regulation."
The far far left at it again
He is so full of shit
I don't believe it was real. I think Trump's team set it up. They wd try anything.
Sounds like more diversity hires in the secret service.
This a joke right?
If AK-47s were banned then this wouldn’t have happened. It’s only because these guns are so readily available that people like this can get their hands on them so easily. Wouldn’t happen with a ban.
Someone wants a poll boost...
He can't be bought. This is why. Harris wearing an ear piece in the debates too lol. These are wild times guys. They don't care anymore
So is this another attempt to kill Trump by a far left lunatic ?....
He'll do anything to get better polls.
It seems the left REALLY don’t want Trump as president. I thought Biden had retired.
All sound too fishy... too convinient.
this is normal behavior for democrats against their political opponents
Narcissists love any publicity!
This should please most BBC viewers..🥸
It's honest shocking what the Left has become. They're so moral that they need to kill Trump in order to save the world and Democracy™. Great people.
Trump needs to be protected at all times.. they wanna take a great man down
Are ready reported to be fake/made up stunt https://youtu.be/RuIQRfp0sU0?si=hLQOQ6o3dbPjBIHv
"YAWN! What's this another put-up job by Trump, desperate for sympathy! He lied and lied about being shot last time, he never was! If he had been shot on the ear he would have no ear left. 

It is all rubbish from this utter pillock, I do not trust Trump on anything, he likely paid this latest shooter, 

This smacks of yet another stunt to draw attention away from how rubbish he was in the debate! Harris is the only real candidate for President and the media should ignore this rubbish and not make out he is some kind of hero! He is nothing of the sort!"
TEN MILES AWAY lmao
This is bs it’s all made up so he gets more votes. Don’t fall for this America
Bore off with your normalisation of yet more trump BS ⚠️⛔️‼️🤮
Those Democrats are trying everything to not let trump win 😮
Lol the lantern fly
They will never let him win.
Safe and well ......still lies
"The free world needs trump,defund the biast,terror supporting bbc"
"lol, sounds credible 🤪🤪"
"It's clearly setup so he can gain more support, since the first act did not give him the enough push to make him definitely win the race, we are in times where you have to twist everything to get things right. And that's what happens when you have a country full of arms and run by the Mossad. 
If the establishment really wanted to kill him they would have done it already and its very easy for them and they wont use guns they are more advance now.
Honestly enough of this fake drama."
Radical Democrats?? Could never be right?
The fake media as is best they don’t know who they trying to kill it’s not difficult to take a guess!!!
I doubt it is a AK 47. As those are incredibly rare and very valuable. Its probably a AKM or mass produced chinese one.
The swamp really really doesn’t want him to be president.
People really need to get better aim
A scope on an AK? That’s more of a spray and pray type instrument
And the secret service says he's safe.... not with you lot
Again this looser@felon with his cheap scenarious?
"Gunshots in the vicinity, could describe anywhere in the US, particularly a state like florida. 
Trump will of course milk it for all its worth and more to try and win support from floaters.

Clactons MP will probably be missing presumed stateside for the next week."
He might be physically well BUT he's clearly not mentally well
He's really upset those Taylor Swift fans eh?
"So, they're still worried he might win the election then?"
Nah this is bullshit now lol
Magot is no longer popular with Magamites.
Mr Popular lol .
At this point trump better just stay at his room
"Let's call it Dogshit Service from now on, ok?"
Ive gotta say while i do not agree with most of what trump says he is one of the coolest and bravest presidents of the usa!
A country full of guns and none of them can shoot straight.
3rd time lucky?
My God on a golf course! We don't want 'A hole In One' of the greatest presidents ever!
Wasn’t on the grounds.  It was no where near him.  Drama Queen Trump.
He is the most disliked convicted felon in America
More bullshit
USA is wild 💀
"Everyone who hates him is gritting their teeth now.
Firstly cause he's safe.
Secondly because they have to report on something that gives Trump favour among the public."
Incredible that people keep blaiming Kamala for this. 🤦‍♂️
Just another GOP attempt to replace Trump with a better candidate who has a higher chance of defeating Harris. Where are my conspiracy theorists?
so what happened to democracy and free and fair elections looks like the candidates are targets ...this is similar to Nicaragua and mexico somebody is funding these shooters
Great. They are investigating themselves?
"So, let me guess... 
Trump will now claim that not only was he shot, but that he caught the bullet with his bare hands and threw it back at the suspect. 
😏"
Another BS all staged to make him look good. How did election degenerate to this?
FBI has confirmed that this was the second attempt on President Trumps life.
Publicity stunt and I bet the newest sneakers are ready to roll out.
Who wants to bet the FBI had various versions of their statement written before the shooting took place?
MK Ultra Soldiers getting activated more and more
Why would they waste taxpayers money on this investigation... IT's FLORIDA! Everyone & their dog carries/uses a gun.  This is a giant nothing-burger. (the campaign is making it out to be more than it is)
Trump really about to die before GTA 6
Anyone else see the bug crawling on his right shoulder?? Haha
Even more reason this man needs to be president.
Time to retire. Go F off to the  golf course with Biden and argue about who banged Hillary first.
Hahaha Poland tells blinken go home get lost.....no one wants to die for your wars
"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 1 Corinthians 15:52-53

Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4

And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. Revelation 13:3"
"Lol... The comedy, the staging ,the election  time in usa then.The First was staged and totally ripped apart.
You just have to point and laugh at them."
Establishment really doesn't like him.
